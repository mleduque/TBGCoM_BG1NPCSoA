@2    = ~Said that he had heard tales of trolls being shackled onto the stone behind the Wailing Dwarf by nagas tryin' ta keep their secrets. Don't know if I be believin' that one though. Them shepherds can be full of shale after only a few ales.~
@3    = ~The pig-bellied, swill-eatin', lowborn swine-tongued worshipers of Cyric are found everywhere these days. They come down from the Cloud Peaks where they have a temple dedicated ta the Prince of Lies called, The Skull Mountain.~
@4    = ~Many of the old shrines here in the Temple District have been defiled and replaced with altars to the Dark Sun and though the Cyricists plot against the other churches and murder citizens, the council does nothing. They're all goin' ta th' Abyss fer this!~

@15   = ~No, you have not.~

Arduke Obar Ghalmrin of Mornaivver was trying ta start trading with dwarves and other surface races for the first time and requested the each clan send envoys ta negotiate a trade agreement. Mornaivver is close ta the surface.. Home to the last clan of Sondarr, Clan Ghlamrin.~
@17   = ~After we had finished that business, we headed ta Iltkazar, the City of Mithral... the sole surviving dwarf kingdom of Deep Shanatar. She lies two miles under the Omlarandin Mountains of Tethyr and acts as a sanctuary for the follwers of Clangeddin Silverbeard.~

I had trade-work at the Iron Throne smithing, but after I told my 'friend', Rieltar, about my old home, and how we had the richest iron mine on any coast, they chained me up and tortured the location of me clan's long abandoned ore mine.

@112  = ~I am wiser as well.~

@114  = ~Bah! What would an old dwarf like you know about the drow?~
@115  = ~I know enough ta see that you are not like the others I have met.~
@116  = ~I wonder if it is because you gave up following the path of that cursed Spider Queen?~ [YESLICK$]
@117  = ~The way of Lloth is an exercise in practicing pointless, outdated rituals that are counterproductive to drow society.~
@118  = ~The powers in charge keep things this way, so they do not lose said power. This is foolish.. I simply decided to follow a different path. One that made more sense.~
@119  = ~Aye.. If you ask me lassie, you being exiling out of Menzoberranzan by the House DeVir was the best thing that could have happened. I mean.. look how human ye have become.~ [YESLICK7]

@130  = ~Good ta see that some things never change. You look good, maybe even stronger than when we last time we saw one another.~ [YESLICK9]
@131  = ~Well, Minsc has been working out a bit. Why, just the other day, Mins and Boo bust out of a magical sealed cage that had no lock or key.~
@132  = ~Boo did most of the hard stuff.~ [minsc34]

@145  = ~Aye.. take that staff out of yer arse and live a little, gramps! Hahahahahah!~ [YESLICKh]
@146  = ~(???)~
@147  = ~I promise you dwarf, if you do not show me the proper respect I shall be forced to use magic to make a complete fool out of you!~
@148  = ~Human promises are shorter than human lifespans.~
@149  = ~Korgan Bloodaxe is a name familiar amongst my clan, as are the Battleragers, the group of mercenaries ya used ta run with.~ [Yeslick_]
@150  = ~Oh?~ [KORGAN24]
@151  = ~The story goes that ye killed yer own family and murdered many other innocents.~ [Yeslick8]
@152  = ~Meh.. people say a lot of things.~
@153  = ~I can tell ya a tale of the Battleragers if ye like.~ [KORGAN31]
@154  = ~As I recall a few years back, when traveling with my fellow Battleragers, we spotted a caravan of pilgrims that were carrying an offering to the temple of Clangeddin Silverbeard across the Starspire Mountains.~

@156  = ~That night we showed no mercy, slaughtering the weak guards and all the pilgrims before stealing the offering. Twas a golden statue of the god, covered in percious jewels, worth an entire kingdom.~ [KORGAN36]
@157  = ~These dark tidings of this massacre reached even my cave.~
@158  = ~So, you are to blame fer this villainous crime?~
@159  = ~What became of the sacred treasure?~ [Yeslick6]
@160  = ~Funny thing.. one, bye one they all the other clansmen started having 'accidents', until only me and my four cousins, Verig, Meggnar, Dalgur and Gikrem were left.~
@161  = ~We was arguing about a fair way to divide the treasure when we were ambushed ourselves by a war party of goblin berserkers.~
@162  = ~If we had not been so greedy and killed all er own clansmen, we coulda fought them off but instead, Dalgur and Meggnar were slain and the treasure, the one we had worked hard so hard to get our hands on, was taken.~ [KORGAN34]
@163  = ~Ahhh.. tis a shame those goblins were not more accurate with their arrows.~ [Yeslickn]
@164  = ~Watch yer tongue Orothiar, lest ye end up like yer clansmen.~ [KORGAN23]
@165  = ~Don't try and frighten me Korgan, I have faced greater warriors than you and beat em.~ [Yeslick5]
@166  = ~Hahahah, yer a funny man Orothiar.~
@167  = ~Yer type are all the same though, so blind in following yer righteous path, ye never see the axe hitting you in the skull from behind.~ [KORGAN02]

@185  = ~Keldorn, does Torm teach ya duty, loyalty, and righteousness?~ [YESLICKa]

@187  = ~I was just comparing the beliefs of the followers of that of Torm and those of my own god, Moradin.~
@188  = ~Believe it er not, we are not so different.~ [YESLICKz]
@189  = ~You are correct good dwarf, tis a pity that the majority choose to war over the differences rather than unite from the similarities.~

@204  = ~I am sorry, my good Turkey, but I simply have to disagree.~
@205  = ~While you would be huffing and puffing, wildly missing, while chasing my shadow, I would be dancing a circle around you while lecturing you on the finer points of performing a soliloquy. For you see, my good Turkey, you cannot defeat that which you cannot touch.~

@225  = ~I suppose you would feel more at home in a cave.~ [VALYGA29]
@226  = ~Aye, put me in some dark, damp, mine with a pickaxe and I feel right at home. I didna used to enjoy mining so much, but it seems, the older I get, the more enjoyment I get from digging a hole and unearthing a precious gem.~
@227  = ~I think It's in me blood. Afterall, my father was a miner, and my mother was a miner before him!~ [yeslickx]
@228  = ~Perhaps you can take your earnings from your years of adventuring and buy yourself a mine of your own for when you retire.~

@237  = ~Yes, many were killed in the first hail of arrows that were unleashed upon us.~
@238  = ~Luckily, I was carryin' a large shield, otherwise I might have fallen right there and then and not be here ta tell the tale.~

@240  = ~I organized the men into a defensive formation that protected us from their long range weapons.~

@242  = ~After an hour of nonstop battle, we outflanked them and began encircling their rear guard, when the second wave hit us by surprise.~
@243  = ~They had at least two dozen battle trolls with them as well as thirty Warg Riders. In the midst of the chaos, our formation was broken and the tide of the battle turned..~
@244  = ~I thought we were done for. Chaos ensued and it soon became a bloody slaughter, with both sides taking heavy loses.~

@251  = ~Ya know what yer problem is, Orothiar?~
@252  = ~Leave me alone, Korgan, I'd rather not speak ta an untrustworthy scoundrel like yerself.~
@253  = ~It's that ya lost the way of the true dwarf.~
@254  = ~The true dwarf, aye?~
@255  = ~I dunna think ye should be the one ta decide what makes a dwarf true.~
@256  = ~People die for wealth and birds die for food.~
@257  = ~Worshipping that pathetic god, Moradin has left you a moralistic weakling.~
@258  = ~The true nature of the dwarves is found in their gold and gems!~
@259  = ~Lost, ya are, beyond any salvation, I reckon.~
@260  = ~Tell me Valygar, what do you know about Moradin?~
@261  = ~Moradin? I know he is the chief deity in the dwarf pantheon, but not much more than that.~
@262  = ~A harsh but fair judge, Moradin is strength and force of will embodied, inspires dwarven inventions and encourages our good nature, intelligence, and harmonious existence with other good races.~
@263  = ~Moradin might be able ta help ya with all yer problems.~
@264  = ~No offense, Yeslick, but how is a dwarven god going to help me?~
@265  = ~Moradin, helps any and all who believe in his power, whether ye be a dwarf are not.~
@266  = ~We clerics of Moradin, known as the Sonnlinor, are honor bound to teach other races of his ways.~
@267  = ~If ye wish, I could show ya the path of Moradin, so that you can find out fer yerself how he can benefit yer life.~
@268  = ~I know you mean well, Yeslick, but I think I have enough of the gods for one lifetime.~
@269  = ~Well, if ya should ever change yer mind, let me know. The Church of Moradin always has room fer someone with a devout heart.~
@270  = ~Yeslick, is it? Tell me, what exactly is your speciality, dwarf? Mining? I find it hard to believe that you could have been trained in the warrior arts.~
@271  = ~Do not underestimate me because of my size, even a clot of sand can sharpen an axe. Besides, where I'm from ye would only go into adventuring because mining was too difficult.~
@272  = ~It takes more than an axe, dwarf. You need to be able to properly use a shield to defend yourself.~
@273  = ~who needs a shield when you have an ale in yer hand?~
@274  = ~Miss Nalia, ya wouldna happen ta have some beeswax in yer pack, would ya?~
@275  = ~These old boots of mine need to be water-proofed or I'll end up with soggy feet again.~
@276  = ~Sure.~
@277  = ~Here you go, Yeslick.~
@278  = ~Thanks very much, m'lady.~
@279  = ~Maybe it is about time that you get yourself some new boots?~
@280  = ~Aye, perhaps you are right m'lady..~
@281  = ~Although, these old things have taken me from Sembia, ta the Sword Coast and all the way to Athkatla. It does na seem right ta toss em out now fer a few holes.~
@282  = ~You sure? I know a cobbler that sells some excellent quality green leather boots from Cormyr for a few copper coins.~
@283  = ~Thank ya, m'lady, but fer the time being I'm goin keep this pair here. Call me an old fool, but I have grown attached ta them.~
@284  = ~Would you look at the majesty of the forest.~
@285  = ~To think that all this would be destroyed if we had left the world in the hands of dwarves.~
@286  = ~Bah! An elfs tongue will talk the Timelight round.~
@287  = ~Did your people ever stop to think about what kind of destruction they were inflicting upon nature when they cut and burned entire forests to feed your mechanical devices?~
@288  = ~Ya pointy ear berry munchers will never understand the ambition of the dwarves.~
@289  = ~Fer ya, life is all about frolicking in the glades and dancing ta flute music. Speech and song are food and drink fer Elves, gold and silver are food and drink fer us.~
@290  = ~We dwarves dunna have the luxury of being able ta play all day long in the sun. Fer us, life is about the sweat ya work up on yer brow when cracking rocks with a pick!~
@291  = ~One day, ya might know the satisfaction of a hard day's work. Even in Elven vales, winter must come.~
@292  = ~Do not try and lecture me, Yeslick, I've seen gnomes with longer beards than you!~
@293  = ~There is nothing as sure in the world as the glitter of gold and the ego of an elf.~ [Yeslickn]
@294  = ~Ya know somethin' Minsc, yer head is hard enough ta crack rock! Ya would have made a fine dwarf!~
@295  = ~Boo and I have worked long and hard for these biceps.~
@296  = ~Mmm.. yer only drawback is that yer head is full of rock as well.~
@297  = ~Ya have ta be crafty ta be a dwarf. We are still the worlds finest engineers, ya know? Who else could build a castle and city inside the belly of a mountain?~
@298  = ~Jaheira, what kind of cheese is this, donkey?~
@299  = ~Ugh! tastes like shale!~
@300  = ~If you don't like it, set aside some gold and buy some for yourself the next time we are at the market.~
@301  = ~Bleh! I think I may just do that.. This stuff is not fit for goblins!~
@302  = ~Stars in the sky! Much wind pours from the mouths of ungrateful dwarves.~
@303  = ~Bad cheese is nothin' ta be grateful about!~
@304  = ~'Twould be good if you tithed a few coins now and then. The favor of gods is worth a few gold..~ [yeslick4]
@305  = ~You would not happen to have a few extra coins for someone down on their luck?~
@306  = ~Here's some gold ta help ya on yer way. Twould be good if we tithed a few coins now and then, <CHARNAME>. The favor of gods is worth a few gold..~ [yeslick4]
@307  = ~I swear, sailing be the best thing in the world. There's nothin' being surrounded in stars while drifitng in a mist with  the wind in yer hair..~
@308  = ~I'll have ta take yer word fer it. Dwarves are not made fer ocean voyages.~ [yeslickx]
@309  = ~By Clangeddin Silverbeard, tis a ghost!! Trouble is always just seventy feet away.~ [yeslicka]
@310  = ~It's so cold..~
@311  = ~We must help the boy ta bring closure ta the matter. Better to delve to deeply than never to delve at all.~ [YESLICKg]
@312  = ~The warmth will come when I have my bear, I know this.~
@313  = ~This looks like a good place to enjoy a dwarven ale. If I wake up next to an ogress. The ale must have been good!~ [YESLICKk]
@314  = ~Aye, I'll drink ta that!~
@315  = ~We have ta help! Even a grumpy old dwarf like me knows it's the right thing to do. Better to delve to deeply than never to delve at all.~ [YESLICKf]
@316  = ~Please... *sniff* *sniff*~
@317  = ~(Yeslick Orothiar, the laid-back, good-natured dwarven cleric of Moradin and Clangeddin Silverbeard. Will he stay by your side, or does he want to leave?)~
@318  = ~Yeslick, I have my soul back. This is my fight, not yours.~
@319  = ~I know we might die in the battle to come. I can't force you to join me, Yeslick.~
@320  = ~You're not going to run off on me, are you?~
@321  = ~For Moradin and Silverbeard, I want to see the end of this long journey. I will follow you and help you slay Irenicus.~
@322  = ~Gah! I dealt with these slimy bastards before.~
@323  = ~They are the Kua-Toa.. paunchy, fish-headed, carnivores with a twisted devotion to their goddess, the Sea Mother, Blibdoolpoolp.~
@324  = ~Trust me, prepare fer a fight. Yer wastin' yer time if ya think ye can talk yer way out of this.~ [YESLICKo]
@325  = ~I've seen magicians cast illusions before, but the quality and quantity of this one are fantastic.. I wonder how he did it?~ [YESLICKs]
@326  = ~If ye thinks she is going to grovel, yer even more foolish than I thought.~ [YESLICK6]
@327  = ~Yer gonna kiss my axe, fer what you've done to Jaheira, ya coward!~ [YESLICK9]
@328  = ~Windspear Hills, eh? Well, frost my beard, that sounds fine by me.. I'd like to explore some more of the region.~ [YESLICKd]
@329  = ~Yes, whatever..~
@330  = ~We are in the depths of the Abyss, aren't we?~
@331  = ~I should have known, the air is so foul down here! Sulphours air, beware. Dead canary do not tarry.~ [YESLICK1]
@332  = ~Meh.. this dunna sound like it's fer me. A dwarf takes pride in his hard work.~ [YESLICK$]
@333  = ~All I want is to get back to dry land!~
@334  = ~Dwarves are not cut out for ocean voyages.~ [YESLICKx]
@335  = ~At last, that fiend Joneleth Irenicus has been destroyed!~ [YESLICK9]
@336  = ~Careful with this one, <CHARNAME>, I have heard terrible things about him.~ [YESLICK7]
@337  = ~Do not be so quick in your judgment, dwarf, the stories you hear might not always be the truth.~
@338  = ~Foul creature of the dark! We shall not be enslaved under yer command!~ [YESLICK5]
@339  = ~*hiss* Shut your mouth dwarf! It's not your decision!~
@340  = ~Ajantis was a good man and did not deserve to meet his end in such a manner. Justice demands we seek out the villain that caused this tragedy.~ [yeslickw]
@341  = ~Aye, this halfling is mad!~ [YESLICK0]
@342  = ~Stivan, I think yer brain flew over the cuckoo's nest.~ [YESLICK3]
@343  = ~We're between the hammer and anvil. Be ready for anything <CHARNAME>, these ogres can be unpredictable.~ [YESLICK9]
@344  = ~I dunna about you, <CHARNAME>, but I've never met a trustworthy ogre.~ [YESLICK$]
@345  = ~I have ta admit, I was wrong about you Madulf.~ [YESLICK7]
@346  = ~No worry about it dwarf, we ogres are used to it.~
@347  = ~Yes well, I learned a lesson. Fer now on, I will try an not judge by the book by the cover.~ [YESLICKu]
@348  = ~Book?~
@349  = ~Teeth of stone, that's one big troll! I dunna think I have ever seen a larger one in my whole life!~ [YESLICK8]
@350  = ~Quickly, take em down! NUTS AND KNEECAPS!! Go fer the knees! Then use fire! Ha! Ill be eating Troll-steak tonight!~ [YESLICK9]
@351  = ~Quickly, take em down! NUTS AND KNEECAPS!! Go fer the knees! Then use fire! Ha! Ill be eating Troll-steak tonight! Ha! Ill be eating Troll-steak tonight!~ [YESLICK9]
@352  = ~I dunna about this one <CHARNAME>, tieflings can be difficult ta get along with.~ [YESLICK$]
@353  = ~Ah, I see that the choice to take me along bothers you, my good dwarf.. is it not so?~
@354  = ~Aye, I didna think it was possible, but I hear ya tieflings are even more annoying than elves!~ [YESLICKn]
@355  = ~Hahaha!! I can see, like peas in a pod, you and me.~
@356  = ~I'd rather shave my grandmother's beard! Oy! I think I'ma gunna be sick!~ [YESLICK1]
@357  = ~Gah! What is a drow doing in a surface cemetery?~ [YESLICK$]
@358  = ~I don't answer to servants, dwarf, I speak for the Spider Queen!!~
@359  = ~I am only a servant fer Moradin, and as one of his clerics, I demand ta know why is a drow in Athkatla?~ [YESLICKa]
@360  = ~It is the will of Lolth and that is all you need know! Now let me speak with the <PRO_RACE> you travel with.~
@361  = ~By Clangeddin Silverbeard! We must be extremely careful! This dragon is very powerful!~ [YESLICKa]
@362  = ~This is true, I am very powerful. Ahh.. you are the ones who fought against Tazok. He is probably dead. A pity, he served me well... but it hardly matters, right now, I wish to speak with <CHARNAME>.~
@363  = ~I dunna like being made to feel like a servant fer evil wizard. Don't ya remember all the trouble he gave us back in Baldur's Gate?~ [YESLICK$]
@364  = ~No good will come from this.~
@365  = ~Yes.. do be quiet, dwarf!~
@366  = ~Here ya go..~
@367  = ~Come now <CHARNAME>, tithing a few coins now and then will grant us the favor of gods.~ [YESLICK4]
@368  = ~*hmph* If they had hired dwarves, they'd have finished in 63 days.~ [YESLICKx]
@369  = ~'Twould be good if you tithed a few coins now and then. The favor of gods is worth a few gold..~ [YESLICK4]
@370  = ~Ahh.. It is always a pleasure ta meet a fellow dwarf. My name is Yeslick, of the dwarven clan Orothiar.~ [YESLICK_]
@371  = ~Well met Yeslick. My name be Cromwell. I am finest blacksmith in Athkatla.~
@372  = ~Dwarves always did make the best blacksmiths. It is nice ta have your mastery recognized by humans though, I'm sure.~ [YESLICKv]
@373  = ~Aye.. tis true.~
@374  = ~How dare ye speak to a lady like that in front of me? Perhaps a nice slap in yer face ought to remind you of yer deceny, BOY!~ [YESLICK6]
@375  = ~I was not speaking to you dwarf, mind you own business, or I shall be forced to deal with you!~
@376  = ~Oi! You cann be talking badly about a pretty halfing lass and threatin me and be thinkin that it's okay, beacuse it ain't! If ye do not show the proper respect, me and ya are gonna have problems!~ [YESLICKx]
@377  = ~Primitive? We dwarves had constructed vast empires spanning entire mountain ranges while ya humans were still dancing naked, worshipping fire.~ [YESLICKs]
@378  = ~Aye, as is blacksmithing, goldsmithing, and mining.. things ye know nothing about, ye tree-hugger!~ [YESLICKr]
@379  = ~Yer companions will more likely stand behind ya as ye unload yer bowels.. to avoid getting our boots messed.~ [YESLICK1]
@380  = ~Leave the hafling lassie alone, wizard! I will not sit here an watch while ya cast some kind of evil enchantment over her.~ [YESLICK5]
@381  = ~You are very rude to interupt, dwarf! Go dig a hole or something, I was speaking to Mazzy.~
@382  = ~I knew she wouldna be interesed in a no-good schemin' wizard like ya, Edwin.~ [YESLICK0]
@383  = ~You are very kind to defend my honor, Yeslick.~
@384  = ~Think nothing of lassie, just doing what I thought in me heart, was the right thing ta do.~ [YESLICKV]
@385  = ~Well, thank you.~
@386  = ~You are most welcome, fair Mazzy..~ [YESLICK!]
@387  = ~Aye! Reminds me of da phosphorescent mushrooms that I saw during me travels in da Feydark, it does.~ [YESLICK$]
@388  = ~All dwarves are kin, but ya are wastin' yer time with that one, bounty hunter! Nothing but a good-fer-nothing merc, who would sell us to slavers fer a bag of silver coins.~ [YESLICK_]
@389  = ~See.. I told ya so! Has the ego of an elf, that one!~ [YESLICKN]
@390  = ~Hey! Watch what ye say!~ [YESLICK5]
@391  = ~If ye ask me, both of ya could use a little time, workin' in da salt mines!~ [YESLICK!]
@392  = ~I've saved a skullbreaker fer ye as well, Yeslick!~ [korgan36]
@393  = ~Ya dunna frighten' me, Korgan! I have met others like ya before. Ya are all talk, and when the time comes fer action, ya go runnin' of like a skunk! Well.. that stinks!~ [yeslick9]
@394  = ~Have some respect, ya gnomish gigolo!~ [YESLICK5]
@395  = ~Nay! I hate to talk badly about another dwarf, but me thinks he is just a no-good mercenary! We dunna need that sort about.~ [YESLICK_]
@396  = ~Have some respect when talking to a lady, ya goblin fondling worm!!~ [YESLICK5]
@397  = ~Hahaha! Erotic arts? We dunna wanna hear about yer stories with yer pack mules!~ [YESLICK0]
@398  = ~This dwarf has the gold fever and if we continue ta follow im, he will lead us ta our doom!~ [YESLICK2]
@399  = ~Stay out of this, ya god-fearin' old fool, ya! I be talkin' ta <CHARNAME> about business!~
@400  = ~Aye.. and miss you we shall.~ [YESLICK0]
@401  = ~Ya idjiot! So we came all this way fer nothin'?~ [YESLICK1]
@402  = ~Oi! I'm gettin' too old fer this stuff!~ [YESLICK3]

// NEW (v.12)
@416 = ~*You are looking at Yeslick Orothiar, a good-natured yet stern dwarf.*~
@417 = ~If you are interested in something, ask. ~
@418 = ~No, no questions. ~
@419 = ~Okay, whatever you like. ~
@420 = ~I know that dwarves live a very long time, much longer than humans. That's why you don't like anything new and stick to tradition, right?~
@421 = ~Yes, we say: "The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years." We are solid and enduring like the mountains we love. While weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change.~
@422 = ~We respect the traditions of our clans, tracing our ancestry back to the founding of most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world. Therefore, we do not abandon these traditions lightly.~
@423 = ~It seems that all dwarves are deeply loyal to their clan. Are they any wars between clans?~
@424 = ~Yes. A wrong doing to one dwarf is a wrong doing to the dwarfs entire clan, so what begins as one dwarfs hunt for retribution can become a full-blown clan feud.~
@425 = ~What do you think of the elf race, Yeslick? ~
@426 = ~Its not wise to depend on the elves. No telling what an elf will do next; When the hammer meets the orcs head, theyre as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword.~
@427 = ~Also theyre flighty and frivolous. Although two things that can be said about them: They dont have many smiths, but the ones they do have, do very fine work and when orcs or goblins come streaming down out of the mountains, an elfs good to have at your back. Although not as good as a dwarf maybe, but no doubt they hate the orcs as much as we do.~
@428 = ~What do you think of the halfling race, Yeslick? ~
@429 = ~Sure enough, theyre pleasant folk, but show me a halfling hero. An empire, a triumphant army, even a treasure for the ages made by halfling hands. Nothing...~
@430 = ~What do you think of the human race, Yeslick? ~
@431 = ~You take the time to get to know a human, and by then the humans on their deathbed. If youre lucky, they've got kin  A daughter or granddaughter, maybe, whos got hands and heart as good as their parent. Thats when you can make a human friend, and then watch them go!~
@432 = ~They will set their hearts on something, theyll get it, whether its a dragons hoard or an empires throne. You have to admire that kind of dedication, even if it gets them in trouble more often than not.~
@433 = ~What do you think of our current quest, Yeslick?~
@434 = ~I can only say one thing; You always have to think first and then act. Many do exactly the opposite and do not fair so well.~
@435 = ~When I'm not sure what to do, I always ask myself, "What would my father do in a situation like this? What would he say about my actions?"~
@436 = ~I think it would be useful for you to remember Gorion in such moments, because it seems that he was a wise man with his heart in the right direction.~
@437 = ~Grrrrrrr!~
