@156  = ~I am glad that you have chosen to act against this evil cult, <CHARNAME>. We need to stop it from influencing any more lost soul to ruin their lives.~
@157  = ~Your father is correct. The followers of Talos kidnap homeless children and sacrifice them to their dark god. It would be wise it you went home, the streets are not a safe place for children.~
@158  = ~Dawnmaster Kreel, it is a pleasure to see you again.~
@159  = ~Ah, Branwen, the pleasure is all mine, my child. Tell me, how are you faring in your studies?~
@160  = ~Actually, I have decided put my studies on hold for the time being. I feel like I can better serve the will of Tempus and Valkur by immersing myself amongst the people.~
@161  = ~Dearest Branwen, we all have our own path we must follow. I'm sure that whatever you have chosen for yourself, the gods will show you divine favor.~

@167  = ~We are not lost souls that would tear our own eyes out to seek truth.~ [branweno]
@168  = ~You are the one that deserves to be thrown in a pit.. A pit of ignorance, for what you have done to yourself.~ [branweno]
@169  = ~I shall not be led anywhere, by a blind charlatan.~ [branweno]
@170  = ~This type of self-serving doomsday prophecy is used to trick people into forgetting their eternal natures.~
@171  = ~Unfortunately, people have a tendency to invest great authority in people who can convince them they have some sort of hidden knowledge that allows them to gain control of their lives.~ [branweno]
@172  = ~Think nothing of it, Jaheira.~

@175  = ~We are just glad that you are feeling better.~
@176  = ~By Tempus, how could a drow create a lair for herself here without the guard knowing?~

@184  = ~Well, it hardly matters.~
@185  = ~I'm sure whoever is in charge only keeps you around for your looks, anyhow.~
@186  = ~How dare you?~
@187  = ~Yes, anyhow..~
@188  = ~This man is not only dangerous, he is also very intelligent.~
@189  = ~Be careful in your dealing with him, <CHARNAME>.~
@190  = ~Honor demands that we help this child, <CHARNAME>.~
@191  = ~Yes, p-please, make <PRO_HIMHER> help!~
@192  = ~This can lead us nowhere good..~
@193  = ~So now we are being followed?~
@194  = ~I don't like it.. Could be a trap.~
@195  = ~By Valkur's mighty blade, we have come to dispense justice on you for your unforgivable crimes!~ [branwen5]
@196  = ~Can it really be the famous DriBranwen Do'Urden?~
@197  = ~By Valkur's strapping buttocks!~ [branwenx]
