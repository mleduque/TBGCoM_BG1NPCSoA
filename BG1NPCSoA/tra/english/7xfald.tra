@69   = ~Foolish girl! Do you really think that mankind will one day just magically learn the erro of their ways and begin to maintain the balance of nature?~
@70   = ~No! They will continue to destroy everything until the world is a grey place choked with steel and smoke. Nothing will be left of the Great Mother or the Oak Father.

@79   = ~I have never doubted that a small group of thoughtful, committed, citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.~

@83   = ~What are you speaking of, surfacer? A mistake is always forgivable, rarely excusable and always unacceptable.~
@84   = ~When you hold resentment toward another, you are bound to that person or condition by an emotional link that is stronger than a fly in a spider's web. Forgiveness is the only way to dissolve that link and get free.~
@85   = ~A good dagger could do it.~
@86   = ~I will learn to forgive my enemies, but I will never forget their names. Afterall, it is natural that the spider feeds on the fly if it wanders too far into the unknown.. So is the way of Mother Nature.~ [FALDO18]

@96   = ~In that case, I'm glad that you just follow orders and are not a leader on your own accord.~
@97   = ~You have some courage to speak to me in such a manner, woman!~
@98   = ~It takes little courage to stand up against one of the Order of the Radiant Heart. You are all corrupt beyond belief.. a symbol of mankind's decadence.~

@103  = ~Ahsdale is with people who are much better suited to raising a child.~
@104  = ~Of that, I have no doubt.~
@105  = ~Who are you to lecture me, Shadow druid? HOw many have died for your beliefs?~
@106  = ~Mere lemmings, who were waiting to run off a cliff anyhow.. All I did was try to give them a little push.~ [FALDO39]
@107  = ~I may be far from perfect, Faldorn, but your flaws are as deep as canyons compared to mine own. You should be the last to throw stones.~
@108  = ~Acceptance of prevailing standards often means we have no standards of our own.~
@109  = ~Foul demon! You have no place in nature! The Great Oak Father demands that all of your kind be killed!~
@110  = ~Ironic, is it not, my Shadow Hawk, that you persecute me, while others among us would have your head for the things you have done?~
@111  = ~Their are higher laws than the petty values that these fools carry with them. The laws of nature must be respected and upheld, and you demons do nothing but destroy that balance!~
@112  = ~Oh really? Come to one of my performances, dear Shadow Hawk, and then tell me that I do not offer anything positive.~
@113  = ~Bah! I will not be charmed by your silver tongue demon!~
@114  = ~Umm.. Trust me, Shadow Hawk, that was the farthest thing from my mind.~
@115  = ~Demon! foul beast!~ [FALDN22]
@116  = ~Are you sure you will not come to a performance, my Shadow Hawk? I can get you free tickets at the the Golden Dragonne Theatre in the Wave District.~
@117  = ~You seem different to me, Imoen, although I cannot place a finger on it.~
@118  = ~I hope you are not talking about my scar, Faldorn, because, I have heard enough about it.~
@119  = ~No, its not that. Something deeper, inside of you has changed. I can sense it. Like a caterpillar, you have gone  through a metamorphosis and have come out a butterfly.~
@120  = ~Well, being tortured and locked up in a dungeon, then tortured and locked up in a magical prison will do a number on you.~
@121  = ~No doubt, but that is not what I am speaking of. I sense something in you. Something of an evil nature.~ [FALDO24]
@122  = ~First you are talking about nice things like butterflies and now you are getting all dark again. Suddenly, I am not enjoying this conversation.~
@123  = ~Do not run from it. We need to understand what is happening or this evil will consume your soul in its entirety!~
@124  = ~Leave me alone, Faldorn! I am not all twisted like you are! I can still tell the difference between right and wrong!~
@125  = ~If we confess our sins, the Great Oak father is faithful and just and will forgive and purify us from all unrighteousness.~
@126  = ~You are still carrying that rodent around with you, Minsc? As formidable a fighter as you are, I would have thought that you would have gotten yourself a tiger to follow you around by now.~
@127  = ~Boo has twice as much courage as a tiger and packs more wallop than an elephant!~
@128  = ~Perhaps, but would it not be more useful to procure yourself a horse?~
@129  = ~Walking everywhere keeps Minsc and Boo fit, so that when evil comes around we can give it a good butt-kicking!~
@130  = ~If that is what you wish.~
@131  = ~Aha! You just want Boo for yourself.~
@132  = ~I must admit a certain fascination. I have always wondered what made him so special.~ [FALDO24]
@133  = ~Well forget about it, Shadow Druid! Boo does not like being held by evil women like you!~
@134  = ~Are you certain? Once you have become a spider, there is no turning back.~
@135  = ~I would never destroy the Trademeet. I just wanted to know how far your madness really went.~
@136  = ~Let all who oppose nature meet their doom at her hands!~
@137  = ~On second thought, I have changed my mind.~
@138  = ~The defilers will pay!~
@139  = ~So be it! I have a legion of Shadow Druids and a horde of wild animals waiting in the forest outside the Trademeet.~
@140  = ~Ugh! I am so bleedin' hungry but the clerics won't let us kill any animals for food and they won't let any caravans bring us any foodstuffs!~
@141  = ~I can't believe how fast things fell to pieces here! The town is overrun by dogs and we people are considered second class citizens to them!~
@142  = ~I wish grab my sword and rid the town of the Shadow Druids and their influence but alas, I cannot even enter my home to fetch it as the dogs have claimed it as their own!~
@143  = ~The Lord of Dogtown is what I have taken to calling myself.~
@144  = ~Has a nice ring to it, don't you think?~
@145  = ~I wonder if I could speak to the head dog about taking a position with more responsibilities.~
@146  = ~I feel like my leadership skills are going to waste ever since this new regime took power.~
@147  = ~If things do not change soon, everyone will be forced to leave the Trademeet. It is impossible to sustain a city with the demands the Shadow Druids have put on us.~
@148  = ~I thought things were bad when the genies were here, but the demands of the Shadow Druids have made business even worse. Everyone is buying up what foodstuffs I have in reserve, but they haven't any gold to pay for it. All they have is copper.~
@149  = ~How am I supposed to leave here with only a few copper coins in tow?~
@150  = ~Sorry, but I am sold out of any foodstuffs. All the towns folk bought what I had in a hurry after the word of the blockade spread.~
@151  = ~The town has gone to the dogs!~
@152  = ~We dare not lay a finger on a dog! The penalty in doing so in Dogtown is death!~
@153  = ~I thought things could not get any worse here. I was wrong..~
@154  = ~The Shadow Druids say they will not attack so long the animals are not harmed. I see little choice but to do what they say.~
@155  = ~Welcome to Dogtown.~
@156  = ~I have tried to have some foodstuffs teleported here from afar but alas, I have had little success.~
@157  = ~One of those dogs bit me!~
@158  = ~Hehehe! I like the doggies!~
@159  = ~The dogs smell bad!~
@160  = ~Watch your step or you will be up to your ankles in dog poop!~
@161  = ~Things have really gone to pot here since the Druids took over. Now, instead of being known as the Trademeet, the locals have taken to calling it Dogtown.~
@162  = ~It is a good thing I stocked up on turnips last winter. Without any caravans coming in from the countryside to bring foodstuffs, many people will not know how to feed themselves.~
@163  = ~The days of the Trademeet are over. This is Dogtown now.~
@164  = ~As soon as I find someone to sell my estate to, I am leaving this forsaken place!~
@165  = ~I fear that all my land holding here have become worthless overnight now that it has become Dogtown.~
@166  = ~Good Gracious! I just stepped in a pile of dog feces!~
@167  = ~Ugh! It is simply impossible to have nice clothes around all these dogs without getting yourself covered in fleas!~
@168  = ~If you are looking for civilization, look elsewhere. Dogs now run this city.~
@169  = ~I can never get a moment of silence with all these cursed dogs barking into the late hours of the night!~
@170  = ~The dogs eat better than we do, I'd wager.~
@171  = ~Being ruled by dogs has changed the lives of many, although I find my life has changed very little.~
@172  = ~The better I get to know men, the more I find myself loving dogs.~
@173  = ~Cursed druids! This place, once known for its riches, is now Dogtown!~
@174  = ~Trademeet was once a place of commerce and industry, now it is the City of the Dogs!~
@175  = ~UGH! The mangy beasts have taken to urinating in my house, but if I lay even a finger on them the druids will have me eaten by wolves!~
@176  = ~The guilds have all moved to Athkatla along with all the wealth they would have brought to the town.~
@177  = ~This is Dogtown now.~
@178  = ~Blasted dogs beat me in poker!~
@179  = ~The streets are covered with dog feces and the people have not eaten in days! I am seriously considering selling my holding here and moving to Athkatla, once all my accounts are settled.~
@180  = ~Nothing to do in Dogtown except drink and think of better times.~
@181  = ~I come here to escape from the dogs! You cannot walk around on the streets without a pack of them chasing you.~
@182  = ~There is much sadness in Dogtown.~
@183  = ~I haven't seen new faces in here since the dogs took over. The druids really did it this time, I tell you.~
@184  = ~Ever since the dogs took over the town, I have been so stressed! I must get a massage from one of Mistress Jeanne's courtesans~
@185  = ~Business has been so slow since the dogs took over.~
