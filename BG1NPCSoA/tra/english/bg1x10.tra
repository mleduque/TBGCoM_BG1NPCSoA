@0    = ~Don't mind the butler. He is a great at cleaning, but quite insane. I think he was mind blasted by an Illithid. Quite a boring story really.~
@1    = ~Anyways, well met stranger. I am Paris of Waterdeep, famed playboy, painter but especially, paramour extraordinaire. I have come to Athkatla to meet all the sexy women of nobility! Ahahaha!~
@2    = ~Lady Goldsword has been kind enough to let me stay me stay in her place until I get situated in the city, so long as I help decorate her villa with my fancy paintings and statues.~
@3    = ~Ahahaha! Oh she is the best! But why are you here? Don't tell me..~
@4    = ~You want to find yourself a person of noble birth to settle down with. Ahahahaha! Not that I blame you. After all, that is exactly what I am doing here too.~
@5    = ~You would not think that the son of a thatcher who for a time was a penniless painter that lived in the gutter would end up here in the Water Gardens, wallowing in luxury and making love to the most beautiful women of the noble class. But, yes, it's true.~
@6    = ~And wait...Now that I gaze upon your face, I know of you! Lady Beth told me that she saw you crawling from some hole in the Promenade after some type of explosion.~
@7    = ~At first, I thought they had just had another mishap in the Adventurer's Mart with some magicks, but then she told me about some dark wizard and a girl getting arrested. You were there, were you not?~
@8    = ~Yes, I was escaping the underground dungeon of an evil wizard who drugged and tortured me..~
@9    = ~Excuse me, I don't have time for idle chatter.~
@10   = ~Yes, yes, I did not ask for your life story. *sigh* You adventurers have such poor manners.~
@11   = ~Anyways, I must do my hair for the party tonight. Word has it that Lady Lasalla might make an appearance and I would hate to not look my best with her around.~
@12   = ~Now where did that butler run off to?~
@13   = ~Lady Héloïse is such a delicate flower.. Ahahahaha!~
@14   = ~Mmmmm.. and she showed me as much when I painted her in the nude. Just don't tell her Uncle Fulbert though! Word has it that he once had one of Héloïse's suitors castrated! Not the kind of man you want to cross.~
@15   = ~Incidentally, if you have been around the Water Gardens for a while, I'm sure that you have heard about the rumors going on about Lord Abelard and Héloïse.~
@16   = ~All I can tell you is that they are absolutely true! The only thing more scandalous is what Rumar is doing with Priss in the back rooms of the Copper Coronet.~
@17   = ~Ahahahaha! Tiana better have herself checked out or her husband is likely to give her a bad case of syphilis! Ahahahaha!~
@18   = ~I heard that you are the one with syphilis and that you are going deaf from it.~
@19   = ~Shouldn't someone tell Fulbert that his niece is being ravaged by her teacher?~
@20   = ~What do you care what Rumar does?~
@21   = ~What is that? Speak louder!~
@22   = ~Err, yes! I don't where you are getting your information from, but I hope it is not the same place that tailors your robes. Ahahahaha!~
@23   = ~Excuse me.~
@24   = ~Best not to get involved. When he does finally find out about what has been happening behind his back, he will certainly send his best assassin to take care of the job. The Harlequin.~
@25   = ~The story goes that the Harlequin sold his soul to become immortal and that no blade, no matter the enchantment can slay.~
@26   = ~All I know is that I would not want someone with that reputation having a dagger near my testicles. Ahahahaha!~
@27   = ~Just making conversation.~
@28   = ~Oh come now! These people are so ridiculous!~
@29   = ~They act so pious when you see them at temple, but behind closed doors these nobles are much more depraved than the poor citizens that they look down nose upon.~
@30   = ~That is why I strive so badly to be amongst their ranks. Ahahahaha!~
@31   = ~I don't know why Lady Jysstev does not convince her husband to have me paint for him rather than that run down hack, Sir Sarles! I am twice the artist that he is!~
@32   = ~You might have seen my work in the art shop that Quataris runs in the Promenade. Or you have probably seen of of those brats selling them of the street corners. I'm telling you, I'm the best artist in all of Amn!~
@33   = ~Perhaps I just need to give Lady Jysstev *a-hem*, a bit MORE convincing, if you know what I mean. Ahahahahahaha!~
@34   = ~Actually one of the temples has asked me to seek your talent for them.~
@35   = ~I met a boy in the Slums that sells painting that are far better than yours.~
@36   = ~Actually, I like the work of Sir Sarles.~
@37   = ~What!? Those know-nothing hacks!?~
@38   = ~Which temple asked you to commission his work?~
@39   = ~It is for the Temple of Lathander, the Morninglord.~
@40   = ~The Temple of Helm has sent me forth.~
@41   = ~The Temple of Talos has sent me to demand his service.~
@42   = ~Show what you know! His work is so puerile and antiquated. My style is far more modern and thus superior.~
@43   = ~However, I would not expect a warrior to understand the intricacies of the art world. My, that would be like a serf ruling the kingdom! Good heavens, could you imagine the chaos!~
@44   = ~Hahahaha! You adventurers are always good for a laugh! Ahahahaha!~
@45   = ~I should have known it would have been them. Those fools understand nothing of art!~
@46   = ~Ahahaha! That fool probably has you looking for pure illithium for him, yes? Ahahahaha! Good heavens! Honestly, who still uses pure illithium?~
@47   = ~Sir Sarles and his followers are so passe. Their style went out last century but they are living on in denial. My fear is that those fashion zombies turn undead for real and continue ruining the art world with their shabby taste in the undeath.~
@48   = ~You are talking about that miserable urchin, Bren, are you not? That little worm!~
@49   = ~He was supposed by my assistant, gathering supplies for me in the Quill District, but instead he steals my best pieces and sells them to a forger named, Olswick! Now the two of them are making a fortune of my hard work!~
@50   = ~Ahahahaha! I can't wait until the city guards arrest those two and hang them! Ahahahaha! Now that will be a real masterpiece!~
@51   = ~By now I'm sure that you have had the unfortunate opportunity to meet Lady Aliella Sapphiredge and her two gargoyles! Ugh! What low-class nobles!~
@52   = ~They used to be regulars here at the dinner parties until Lady Goldsword caught her friend, Ravhana, fornicating in the pool downstairs. Ahahahaha! Suffice to say, she was quite upset and thus banned Aliella and her two friends from ever attending one of her dinner parties again.~
@53   = ~That is what happens when you let merchant class brats attend functions made for nobility. Brainless, the lot of them! They don't even appreciate art! All they care about is some stupid bard and his stupid songs. Those harlots are nothing but a waste of time! Ahahahaha!~
@54   = ~Count Claylan is a damned fool is he believes the lies that the Debutante Alicia is feeding him! She is nothing but a lying, gold-digging harlot!~
@55   = ~What's more, she is horrible betwixt the sheets! Ahahaha! She paid me in flesh for some nude portraits I painted of her and I still felt ripped off! Mmmm.. yes.~
@56   = ~Anyways, tell me when Oriana gets here. Mmmm.. now that is a woman whose flower has some tasty nectar. Ahahahaha! yes, what I would not do to have a rich girl like her take me under her wing. Ahhhh... Living in the Government District and not needing to paint the ceilings of the villa you are living in to earn a living.~
@57   = ~Knowing how things go though, she will probably end up with some troll-faced government official like Trax! Or even worse, one of the Argrim Family. Ugh! What arrogant people! They always keep their long noses pointed in the air, thinking they are better than everyone else!~
@58   = ~But as bad as the Argrims are, the Roenals are even bigger criminals than they. Lord Roenal acts all high and mighty during his strolls down the Water gardens, but his son, Isaea, is caught up in all kinds of corruption.~
@59   = ~His other son Quint is a drunken fool that spends all his coin drinking at the Blue Unicorn and fornicating with trollops. Ha! Oriana might be better off marrying the leader of the Shadow Thieves, than one of those brutes. Ahahahahahaha!~
@60   = ~I finally got done painting the ceiling downstairs and chiseling that statue. Now I have to paint the ceiling up here.~
@61   = ~I wonder if anyone has ever made so little money for working so hard on their back before? *sigh* The work of a famous artist is never done.~
@62   = ~You? You have it easy. All you have to do is kill some goblin and take his gold coins. Me? I have to create a masterpiece if I want to see another gold coin again. Yes, the life of an adventurer is a simple one.~
@63   = ~Whatever you do, don't get caught up talking with that wizard across the hallway. Strange sort, he is. Never heard of him before, but they say where he comes from, he is quite the legend.~
@64   = ~I wouldn't know anything about that though. All I know is that he is too cheap to buy a painting from me.~
@65   = ~Are you seriously trying to say that the life of an artist is harder than that of an adventurer?~
@66   = ~Do you mean to tell me that you have never heard of Elminster? Are you some kind of fool?~
@67   = ~How much for one of your masterpieces?~
@68   = ~What is he famous? I could not imagine what for.. Pulling rabbits out of his hat and juggling apples, perhaps?~
@69   = ~In any case, who cares? Magic is so dreadfully boring to learn. And despite all the powers available to them, they still lack the creativity of a man with a brush.~
@70   = ~Ahahahaha! They say that every wizard is just another failed artist.~
@71   = ~Well, naturally. All you have to do is kill some mangy beast and collect gold coins. The job of an artist is ten times as difficult.~
@72   = ~For you see, an artist must not only find inspiration, he must also inspire everyone in the world around him. Not only is it more difficult, it is more noble as well.~
@73   = ~Ahahahaha! Would like to have an original Paris for yourself, would you? Who can blame you? Yes, I am that good! Ahahahaha!~
@74   = ~Well, I'm sure that we can reach some kind of arrangement. Unlike Sir Sarles, I won't require pure Illithium. However, I will require a large deposit of platinum coins.~
@75   = ~We can work out the details later. For now, leave me be while I try and gather some inspiration.~
@76   = ~A good business to you, my <LADYLORD>, and welcome to the Water Gardens!~
@77   = ~I am Davanor Gilderberg of Trademeet. After all the problems we have been having with the druids and genies there, I've decided to come to Athkatla to sell my wares!~
@78   = ~Come, take a look around. I can assure you that it is all of platinum quality!~
@79   = ~Yes, let's see what services you have.~
@80   = ~Excuse me, I'm afraid I must be going.~
@81   = ~To hear, is to obey.~
@82   = ~Very well, my <LADYLORD>. You are welcome to my shop at any time, however.~
@83   = ~Aha! I knew you be back! After all, Davanor Gilderberg has the finest quality goods in the Water Gardens, at the best prices too.~
@84   = ~So, what will it be today? I've brought the finest selection that the Trademeet has to offer!~
@85   = ~Oh look, one of those druids. ha! With those clothes, it looks as if he just climbed down the side of a mountain. Hahahaha!~
@86   = ~Excuse me there...the fellow in the robes.  Could you hail a carriage for me now? I would like to be taken home.~
@87   = ~Oh... you look just like one of my maids, there, elf. Perhaps you would care to fill in for her? My wardrobe has just been ghastly to organize without her.~
@88   = ~Darling Nalia!  Excuse my asking, my dear, but what are you doing with a bunch of commoners, hmmm?~
@89   = ~Oh, how absolutely delicious! If it isn't Valygar Corthala! How is your mother, darling boy?~
@90   = ~You there... in them dirty leathers... you are one of them Corthalas, are you not? I thought you and your kind were all dead and buried, by now. 'Least, that's what I've heard.~
@91   = ~Well, well, well.  If it isn't Lord Keldorn, himself.  You should keep a closer eye on Lady Maria, I think, my Lord.  *chuckle*~
@92   = ~Ah, you're an entertainer, are you not? You are one of that troupe I was brought to recently.~
@93   = ~Quite good...for local entertainment, anyway. Are you hear to provide music for the fights?~
@94   = ~What is this? A member of the dark elves brazenly wandering the streets?! Outrageous!~
@95   = ~Ah, a dark elf here in the good districts. I thought the guards would herd you people off to the slums, along with the halflings and dwarves. Think of the property values!~
@96   = ~By Helm, you have fuzzy hair all over your feet! Why don't you wear shoes, then, to hide it? Although, I'm not sure what type of maiden shoes would fit those big feet you have!~
@97   = ~You're a gnome, aren't you? Mother always said that gnomes are good for nothing other than decorating the grounds.~
@98   = ~Well, I'll be... yor are the bloody gnome I bought that gizmo from! Fourteen gold coins and the blasted thing doesn't even work!  Give me my money back, you thief!~
@99   = ~Oh, how cute!  You've given one of the little people a weapon to play with!  If my children were here to see this, they would be SO delighted!~
@100  = ~Oh dear!  A smelly dwarf!  I had no idea they were allowing their kind into the city!~
@101  = ~Hmmm, are you going to be fighting, Rashemite? You certainly seem barbaric enough.~
@102  = ~Everything that has gone wrong these days is because of those vile elves...they are the plague of the world, I tell you!~
@103  = ~Did you know that they once ruled the entire length of Faerûn in one magnificent empire, but let it all crumble into ruins  thanks to their inherent laziness?~
@104  = ~You are wrong. Elves still excel in everything in which they partake.~
@105  = ~You have no idea what you are talking about, woman!~
@106  = ~Have you noticed that I am a half elf?~
@107  = ~Have you noticed that I am an elf?~
@108  = ~Please, don't make me laugh! They are good for singing songs, dancing in musicals, and the women for romancing our men, but those goo-for-nothing elves are never useful in anything else.~
@109  = ~Perhaps in the world of adventuring they are able to chop more firewood or kill more orcs, I have no idea, but I don't see a practical purpose for those lazy urchins!~
@110  = ~Oh really? Well, I studied at the university here in Athkatla. Where did you ever study, except for plowing on the farm?~
@111  = ~Naturally! Why else would I be telling you this?~
@112  = ~You adventurers are not very smart, are you?~
@113  = ~Oooh, throw a coin in that fountain and make a wish! Hahaha!~ [NOBFE03]
@114  = ~No! You look like a kobold! I bet you don't spend a red copper unless it's pried from your fingers!~
@115  = ~That shows what you know. I have enough gold to buy the entire Water Gardens if I wanted!~
@116  = ~I suppose you only hold people with large amounts of platinum in high esteem.~
@117  = ~No sense in spending good coin on things that I don't need.~
@118  = ~Hahahaha! That is rich! Unlike you!~
@119  = ~Hahaha! You mean to tell me that gained that amount of riches by slaying goblins? Hahahaha! You must be an expert!~
@120  = ~Since you are so good at ridding places of inferior creatures, perhaps you can use you vast array of skills to rid the Slums and Docks of all the rats that infest those dingy places.~
@121  = ~Then you would do us all the pleasure of ridding us of your presence!~
@122  = ~Such manners!  And on such an occasion! I should have expected as much from a peasant turned wealthy by means of adventuring.~
@123  = ~Your fame and wealth grant you the privilege of walking among us here in the Water Gardens, but do not make the mistake of thinking that you are one of us. Begone, you loutish foole.~
@124  = ~You are not really going to try and strut around the Water Gardens in that outfit, are you? Why, I would simply die from the embarrassment!~
@125  = ~Although, for a renowned adventurer like you, I suppose it might suffice. What? You did not think that I recognized the famous Hero of the Sword Coast? <CHARNAME>, is it not? Yes, we know all about you. We have heralds, you know.~
@126  = ~You were a farmer in Candlekeep before becoming an adventurer, were you not? Yes, quite a name you have made for yourself..~
@127  = ~It's just too bad that all those quests keep you so busy that you have not had the time to do some shopping for a proper outfit. UGH! You look simply dreadful in those rags!~
@128  = ~People such as yourselves might wish to go to the Copper Coronet. Rabble collect there often to discuss, ah, whatever it is that you discuss.~
@129  = ~Good gracious, your breath stinks! UGH! I thought it was going to turn me to stone! Hahahahaha!~
@130  = ~Ahhhh.. the wine is sure good tonight! Hahahaha! Anyways, what brings you rabble to the Water Gardens? It is not often that we get your type of peasant warriors here.~ [NOBFE04]
@131  = ~I came to see where the rich and famous of Athkatla spend their time.~
@132  = ~Just wanted to see if your merchants had any unique magical items.~
@133  = ~I'm trying to find the university.~
@134  = ~I just came to admire the flora.~
@135  = ~You mean that you found time out of your busy schedule of slumming your way from the brothels to visit us here? Oh joyous day!~
@136  = ~The next thing you know, Drizzt Do'Urden will come crawling out from the Underdark and expect us to kiss his arse too! Hahahaha!~
@137  = ~What a queer fellow you are.~
@138  = ~Hahaha! Why would you want to know where the university is? Oh wait.. I know!~
@139  = ~You are going to give a lecture on the economics of adventuring. Surely, when one has to collect gold coins off the bodies of dead goblins, one has interesting stories to tell.. Bwhahahaha!~
@140  = ~And just what are you going to use to buy said magical items, hmmm? Some gold from your royal treasury? Hahahaha!~
@141  = ~Look, does this look like the Promenade to you? Do you see animal dung lining the streets here? Do you hear noisy hawkers  trying to get to to enter their rat infested stores?~
@142  = ~This is the Water Gardens. It is going to take more than the few coins you found on the bookshelf to buy luxury goods around these parts. Why don't you do yourself a favor and go back to the Slums where your type belongs, aye? Now pip-pip.. I'll not have you near me!~
@143  = ~I knew the great wizard, Elmister, was too important to come seek the treasured pipe that my trusted servant, Ver'jin, stole for me. No matter. I have been dead for a thousand years, waiting for my revenge. A moment longer will not worry me.~
@144  = ~I suppose an introduction is in order. I am, Undarl Dragonrider, former Magelord of Athalantar. It was I, mounted upon a draco-steed, that reduced Elminster's parents, Elthryn Aumar and Amarythale Goldsheaf, to nothing but heaps of ash.~
@145  = ~And you are, <CHARNAME>, Hero of the Sword coast and child of Bhaal. You must be curious as to why I have lead you here.~
@146  = ~Nobody needs to get hurt. Just give me the pipe and we can go our separate ways.~
@147  = ~If it makes you feel better before you die, go ahead and tell me.~
@148  = ~I think I have the wrong room. Excuse me.~
@149  = ~Lead me here? I came for Elminster's pipe.~
@150  = ~You will die for what you have done!~
@151  = ~How do you know who I am?~
@152  = ~Silly little thing, this pipe. Rather useless magical trinket isn't it? However, I knew that foolish wizard could not be at peace without it.~
@153  = ~Knowing that Elminster would not want to trouble himself with such a minor nuisance, he sent you in his stead, just as I had planned.~
@154  = ~Oh, but I did die. My body was consumed in the flames of a great ball of fire cast by the mighty Elminster himself. Yet I have returned to Faerûn to retake what is rightfully mine.~
@155  = ~That is why I am glad you have arrived.~
@156  = ~Consider yourself lucky that I spare the time to give you the satisfaction of knowing why you are about to killed, fool!~
@157  = ~From what I had heard of you, I did not think you a coward. It seems that the storytellers have it all wrong though.~
@158  = ~Not that it matters. Your story ends here.~
@159  = ~Don't think me a fool just because I have been dead for a thousand years. I am privy to such ancient knowledge that the so-called wizarding masters of today could not even begin to fathom.~
@160  = ~I know exactly who you are. That is why you are here.~
@161  = ~The truth is, that I am not made of this crude flesh that you see before you. I am a Shadowmaster from a distant realm.~
@162  = ~I need the soul of a powerful Bhaalspawn to resurrect the draco-lich, Rauglothgar. I was originally planned to use Sarevok, but after you defeated him in battle and became a hero, you wrote your own fate.~
@163  = ~Once I have Rauglothgar under my control, all of Faerûn will burn and the might Elminster will finally meet his doom.For that to happen though, I must slay you.~
@164  = ~Remember what I said about not being made of this crude flesh? Well.. I have one more secret for you.~
@165  = ~By Mystra! If this teleportation spell doesn't work this time, I'm going to buy a horse and ride that to Athalantar!~
@166  = ~Arrggh! That is going to be difficult though because as any wise man knows, Athalantar existed a thousand years in the past!~
@167  = ~*sigh* Too bad I'm not in Hillsfar. They have the best horses there. Lots of fences of bails of hay in the road though.~ [ELMIN06]
@168  = ~Yes well, it seems even wizard needs a full stomach before he can replenish his spell power.~
@169  = ~In any case.. Well met, I am the Sage of Shadowdale, Elminster Aumar, although I have also been known to some people as Eladar "the Dark".~ [ELMIN01]
@170  = ~Perhaps you have heard of me.~
@171  = ~Can you create a fireball as big as a house?~
@172  = ~Did you just say that you were Elminster?~
@173  = ~We met once in Baldur's Gate.~
@174  = ~Sorry, no.~
@175  = ~Well, Of course I can! You don't get to be called the Sage of Shadowdale if you cannot do some impressive magic tricks.~
@176  = ~I can summon a fireball so large that it could consume an entire forest! But not on an empty stomach..~
@177  = ~So you have heard of me. I was beginning to think that people of your generation no longer read books and that perhaps my deeds had become forgotten.~
@178  = ~In any case, it is nice to meet you and all, but if I am going to reach Athalantar by horseback, I'm going to have to have a nice meal beforehand.~ [ELMIN07]
@179  = ~Hmmm.. yes well. It seems you can survive the tortured of the damned in Hell and with the help of Simbul, defeat an arch-devil, you can be forgotten again in a few short years.~
@180  = ~I think I'm going try this spell one more time and if it does not work this time, I going to head downstairs and see what they have on tap.~
@181  = ~Are you certain? Perhaps you have this life mixed up with another one of yours.. In any case, it is nice to meet you and all, but if I am going to reach Athalantar by horseback, I'm going to have to have a nice meal beforehand.~
@182  = ~Well, it looks like I might be here a while. At least the Goldswords have the best accommodations.~
@183  = ~However, even here I am not safe from these pestering wizards that are always trying to challenge me.~
@184  = ~One of those wizards sent a devious imp that stole my pipe! I must get it back before I make my presentation at the university. Time is of the essence and the quest will not be easy.~
@185  = ~But then again, you are <CHARNAME>,  Hero of the Sword Coast. I would never ask you to do such a menial task, but because I have presentation at the university and make an appearance at the dinner party, I have to ask you for this favor.~
@186  = ~Normally it is not impossible for me to be at two places at once as I am a practicing chronomancer, but recently my magic has been acting up.~
@187  = ~Please, would you track down that devious imp and retrieve my pipe? I would be ever grateful.~ [ELMIN01]
@188  = ~Sorry, but I have other important quests that I must do and don't have the time to do menial tasks for mere gratitude.~
@189  = ~Very well. Do you have any idea where this imp may have gone?~
@190  = ~Get lost, old man! I have better things to do with my time!~
@191  = ~If I must. Tell me, where you think I can find this imp?~
@192  = ~It would be an honor to help the great, Elminster.~
@193  = ~I understand. I guess I could always use a spell to turn back time and safeguard my pipe in a magical chest before the imp stole it, but that will require much time and effort.~ [ELMIN06]
@194  = ~Hmmm.. Or perhaps some other adventurers will be willing to take the job. Surely there are some brave souls out there that need the work. Sorry to have wasted your time.~ [ELMIN03]
@195  = ~Thank you for agreeing to help.~
@196  = ~I believe that the imp in question was created by a rival mage working from the Crooked Crane near the City Gates.~ [ELMIN04]
@197  = ~Please hurry! I despise speaking in public without having a good puff from my pipe first.~ [ELMIN05]
@198  = ~Have you managed to retrieve my pipe?~ [ELMIN05]
@199  = ~I have your pipe right here.~
@200  = ~Sorry, I have not found it yet.~
@201  = ~By Mystra! That's much better! Here is something for your trouble.~
@202  = ~They say Jarlaxle, the leader of the Bregan D'aerthe mercenary band, is in Ust Natha... unlikely as he was recently humiliated by the Matron of House Jae'llat.~ [ELMIN04]
@203  = ~The head of the Mage Tower in Ust Natha, Deirex, is allied with the House Jae'llat.  The lich-wizard was once a member of the Jae'llat family itself.~ [ELMIN04]
@204  = ~Spellhold is no place to heal. Seen mage after mage go in, as well as a whole lot of other difficult people, but I have never seen a one of them come back out.~ [ELMIN04]
@205  = ~Some say the witch Umar has surfaced again.  She vanished 700 years ago, but legend holds that every century or so her reign of murder and torture begins again.~ [ELMIN04]
@206  = ~Although I was unaware of the fact for some time, I have a few daughters.~ [ELMIN01]
@207  = ~I first learned of it when a loner thief named, Narnra Shalace of Waterdeep, followed me through an alleyway and into a portal that I had created, that lead to Marsember.~
@208  = ~Because of her curiosity, Narnra quickly finds herself involved not only in the intrigues of the Cormyrean nation, but also with with me, as it turned out that I was the father, who she has never known.~
@209  = ~Besides Narnra, I also had two others daughters. They are Laspeera of the war wizards and the Dowager Queen Filfaeril of Cormyr.~
@210  = ~My thinking was instrumental in forming the Rangers Three, who aided in the recurring battles with the mysterious Shadowmasters.~
@211  = ~I also took time out to defend Shadowdale from an army of Zhentarim led by the avatar of Bane.~ [ELMIN07]
@212  = ~As Bane and I were locked in an epic battle, we both became caught up in the spell that I had called upon to dispose of the avatar.~
@213  = ~I was originally thought to have been destroyed, but when I later reappeared it became apparent that I had merely been transported to another plane of existence for a period of time.~
@214  = ~Lady Goldsword holds some of the finest parties I have ever attended. Too bad the pork is a bit salty. Ah well, they are rich, not wizards.~
@215  = ~Other than the over-salted pork, the only other bad thing is having that insufferable Lord Abelard follow me around, asking me the meaning of life. As if such a thing was so simple, as to be discussed as dinner conversation. The man is quite simply dull.~
@216  = ~He has even convinced me to do a lecture at the university regarding magic, and its many uses. I cannot believe I allowed myself to be talked into such a thing, but after a puffs from my calabash pipe, I was willing to say anything to get that man away from me. The nerve of some people. I swear, I shall turn him into a toad if he asks me to debate the nature of the gods again with that annoying voice of his.~
@217  = ~*sigh* I suppose I should prepare a few magic tricks for the eager students. Something big and flashy. After all, they are not paying all that gold to learn how to make rabbits appear from hats.~
@218  = ~I must say that it is remarkable how much they use magic to keep the Water Gardens in such pristine shape. Usually, government officials frown upon the excess use of magic within city streets, but that is not the case here.~
@219  = ~The buildings are magically heated during the winters, the street light are powered by ever-bright spell magic and the water is magically treated to make sure it is pure.~
@220  = ~Some things, like trash pickup are still cheaper if done by servants, but eventually even that might change. Who knows what the future holds if mankind embraces magic instead of fears it.~
@221  = ~I was born in 212 DR to Elthryn, the lord of the village of Heldon and a prince of Athalantar, and his wife Amrythale, in the kingdom of Athalantar. My family was killed by a malaugrym named Undarl, one of the magelords of the ancient kingdom of Athalantar.~
@222  = ~Taking up my father's broken blade, the Lion Sword, the symbol of my grandfather, the great king of the Stag Throne, I became a brigand and a thief at the ripe age of twelve.~
@223  = ~I soon realized that I had no taste for killing, and gave it up to become a burglar in the city of Hastarl, the capital of Athalantar.~
@224  = ~I met and formed a bond of friendship with a young thief, Farl, who knew me as Eladar "the Dark". We committed many acts of thievery and lived life fully, later forming the gang the "Velvet Hands" in opposition to the rival gang, the Moonclaws, who were servants of the magelords.~
@225  = ~Later during a burglary, I met the Magister of the time, the wizard who bore the mantle of Azuth's power. When he asked if I was interested in learning sorcery, I refused, as I hated all mages because of the magelords.~
@226  = ~After many adventures, I was visited by Mystra, the Goddess of All Magic. She tarried with me and left a message that I should learn of magic and worship her.~
@227  = ~Soon thereafter, while I was still a young adult, Mystra transformed me into a woman named Elmara to strengthen my bond with magic and to know what it is to be a woman. This change also allowed me to move within his enemies' circles without their knowledge that I was in fact the last surviving prince of Athalantar.~
@228  = ~For a few years, I lived as Elmara, a priestess of Mystra. Later, an avatar of Mystra, who went by the name Myrjala "Darkeyes", trained me in the ways of a mage and brought me to an ancient Netherese arcanist who taught me a spell that would transform me back into Elminster.~
@229  = ~In the time that followed, I learned much about magic from Myrjala, reaching the point where I could finish taking my revenge against the evil magelords who had usurped the kingdom. After a terrific battle, I persevered and assumed the throne of Athalantar.~
@230  = ~However, no sooner had I gained the kingship than I passed it to one of my friends, Helm Stoneblade, a knight of Athalantar. After all, I had wanted to avenge my family's death, not become a monarch.~
@231  = ~As Myrjala and I left the kingdom, the so-called Mage Royal, Undarl, attacked us, and the sorceress revealed herself to be Mystra. She offered to make me her Chosen, and I readily accepted.~
@232  = ~I later also freed High Dale and defeated Manshoon of the Zhentarim, but that is another story.~
@233  = ~When the floating city of Thultanthar was returned to Faerûn after their exile in the Plane of Shadow, the Shadovar came to Shadowdale to ambush me. In the confrontation spells were thrown, and Storm blasted one of the shadow princes with a ball of silver fire.~ [ELMIN05]
@234  = ~Since Shadovar are living shadow magic, and silver fire is pure Weave magic, the collision between the two tore at the fabric of reality, creating a rift to the Nine Hells. I realized that the only way to close the portal before legions of devils spilled forth into Toril was to close it from the other side.~ [ELMIN01]
@235  = ~I entered the portal and narrowly managed to do so, but at the expense of much of my magical powers. Once in Hell I was abducted and enslaved by an outcast arch-devil known as Nergal, who wished to discover the secret of Mystra's silver fire, and so subjected me to brutal tortures. I only survived only because of my exceptional endurance and ability to heal myself with silver fire.~
@236  = ~While the arch-fiend plundered my thoughts and memories, Mystra became aware of her favorite servant's plight and entered Hell herself to find me.~
@237  = ~Realizing that her presence in Hell was overly conspicuous, Mystra retreated and dispatched more subtle agents to find me.. first Halaster Blackcloak, the Mad Mage of Undermountain, who was defeated.. and then the Simbul.~
@238  = ~After much searching, the Simbul found me, and together we defeated Nergal and returned home.~
@239  = ~I met Iymbryl Alastrarra in the woods surrounding the elven capital, while the elf was fighting ruukha hobgoblins.~
@240  = ~Iymbryl asked me to take the kiira to his family in Cormanthor. The kiira gave me the ability to change my shape into that of Iymbryl in the hopes of easy passage into Cormanthor.~ [ELMIN06]
@241  = ~That came in handy as the Starym, the oldest family in Cormanthor, believed that humans were no better than beasts. Llombaerth Starym sought to undermine the creation of the Mythal to attempt to keep humans from being allowed into Cormanthor.~ [ELMIN05]
@242  = ~I was guided to the Towers of Song, where Eltargrim was Coronal. I remained there for twelve summers and more, studying with many mighty mages, learning to feel magic and feeling how it could be bent and directed to my will.~
@243  = ~I became an armathor and was present and helped create the mighty magic that was spun when the Mythal was raised and the city renamed Myth Drannor.~ [ELMIN07]
@244  = ~I could not believe it when i found out that great-great granddaughter through Narnra Shalace! Her name was Amarune Whitewave and she worked as a nude mask dancer at the private Dragonriders Club, occasionally doing more than just dancing for her customers!~ [ELMIN01]
@245  = ~Don't ask me how I know these things.. let's just say that I have a way of seeing the future. Which reminds me, I nigh forgot what I myself must be about, this evening! I am going to polymorph a rat so it will look like I am dancing with a dragon.~ [ELMIN06]
@246  = ~*sigh* All those sharp claws.. 'tis like being married, I tell thee! Well, fair forays 'til next we meet, gentles!~ [ELMIN08]
@247  = ~So, you are the one from the disturbance in Waukeen's Promenade. From the stories that I have been told, I would have thought you were taller.~
@248  = ~Word to the wise, you'd best be careful, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.  We've already arrested a druid for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. People are looking for a reason to put a noose around your neck. I'm sure you don't want to be giving them a reason to do so, aye?~
@249  = ~Anyhow, just what brings you to the Water Gardens anyhow? Come now.. You may be able to fools the others into thinking you belong here, but I am on the council and know better.~
@250  = ~I was hoping I could meet someone that might help me with some problems I have been having with the Cowled Wizards.~
@251  = ~I was hoping to enroll myself at the university here.~
@252  = ~I came in search of adventure and treasures as always.~
@253  = ~I'm sorry, but I really must be going.~
@254  = ~Just came to admire the flora.~
@255  = ~*Hmph* I would have thought that a person of your reputation would have a more defined purpose for wandering into a gated community.~
@256  = ~Come now, tell me why you have really come here. I know many influential people around the city, people that might let you clear up that whole incident in the Promenade.~
@257  = ~I might be able to help you, depending on what it is you need. Never did like those Cowled Wizards. So dark and imposing. Always going and arresting people with little to no evidence on the basis of security.~
@258  = ~What kind of security takes away the fundamental freedoms of the people and empowers arcane sorcerers? The Cowled Wizards are growing too powerful and something must be done about it.~
@259  = ~*sigh* Tell me how I can help you. I would do anything to stick my thumb in their eyes.~
@260  = ~Can you provide me with passage to Brynnlaw? I must reach Spellhold.~
@261  = ~I need to break my friend, Imoen, out of Spellhold.~
@262  = ~Of course. Being on the council does provide me with certain luxuries. However, why bother when you already have a deal with the Shadow Thieves.~
@263  = ~I see that secrets are hard to keep here in Athkatla.~
@264  = ~Actually, my plans have changed.~
@265  = ~I have no idea what you are talking about.~
@266  = ~How do you know that?~
@267  = ~Really? I hope it was not with that vampire guild.~
@268  = ~They will double-cross you the second they have the chance. Do not put your trust in them.~
@269  = ~I am not going to tell you who I am working with.~
@270  = ~I found a way to Brynnlaw with someone else.~
@271  = ~I can take care of myself.~
@272  = ~Just be careful once you get there, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Depending on the amount of drunk pirates, Brynnlaw can be a very dangerous place.~
@273  = ~However, pirates will be the last thing you need worry about if you start using magic illegally there. I know of the magical prison where they lock people who use unregistered magic without trial.~
@274  = ~Just because I don't trust the Cowled Wizards, it does not mean that I do not make use of their services. Someone in my business cannot afford to be lacking in vital information.~
@275  = ~Yes, I know all about the deal that you struck with the Shadow Thieves and I must say that I agree with your choice. Traveling with them will keep you from having to pay certain tariffs that arise when outsiders try and travel around the realm.~
@276  = ~Good luck to you in finding your friend, but do not trust in hope. Also, be sure that you do not try and double cross the Shadow Thieves. I have heard that they have a dastardly torture they use on traitors. They scoop the eye socket, making certain to do no damage to the nerves inside.~
@277  = ~Still enjoying the sight at the Water Gardens, aye? You must have a reason for being here other then to admire the fountain. Come now.. Tell me what you are looking for.~
@278  = ~Lord Farthington thinks he is so high and mighty, but if he knew the dealings that his family was involved in, he might act differently.~
@279  = ~His son, Isaea has possession of smuggled gems, a fact proven by his own records. Isaea also finances pirates. I have a witness to these events; a man named Barg.~
@280  = ~His other son, Quint is a drunkard and a fool! He spends all his coin on courtesans and purple lotus.~
@281  = ~You say that you know someone that can implicate Isaea to smuggling?~
@282  = ~What I would not give to punch Quint Roenall in the face!~
@283  = ~Yes, a man named Barg. He spends a lot of his time in the Sea's Bounty in the Docks. He is the one that told me of Isaea's misdeeds after a few too many drinks.~
@284  = ~Watch yourself if you intend on going after Isaea Roenall though. He is an officer in the army and has many powerful allies throughout the city.~
@285  = ~However, there are those that would have him brought down. Khellor Ahmson is such a man. He is also an officer in the army, an officer that competes with Isaea for many posts.~
@286  = ~You would have to wait in a long line before you got the chance. Many would like to see that brat taught a lesson.~
@287  = ~Unfortunately, the Roenalls have powerful friends amongst the Council and the army so that will probably never happen.~
@288  = ~The man is a worm! When the de'Arnise Estate was attcked, instead of sending aid, all Quint Roenall did was try and figure out a way that he could profit from all that death! Hopefully he gets what he deserves and is arrested for trafficking purple lotus from Amkethran in Tethyr. Someone will need proof of this for anything to happen though.~
@289  = ~My wife is such a harpy, she is. This be the only place I can come to be away from the woman.~
@290  = ~I went with my wife to at the Five Flagons, the official playhouse of Athkatla for a showing of the Turmish play! Things always go wrong during a run of the Turmish play. Always. You can count on it.~
@291  = ~Someone crossed the sorcerer whom this play laments, you can be sure. Still, we both rather enjoyed the show. I recommend it if you have the time.~
@292  = ~My wife keeps nagging me to go to the promenade and do some shopping with her.  Ach, but 'tis such a far walk...maybe I'll go the tavern and just say I was robbed.~
@293  = ~What can you tell me about Athkatla's lesser known districts.~
@294  = ~Isn't there a bigger theater in the Wave District?~
@295  = ~You are absolutely correct!~
@296  = ~The Golden Dragonne Theatre host many plays and concerts during the year. Only the most affluent and influential get invited to those exclusive performances.~
@297  = ~However, my wife prefers the more rustic feeling of the Five Flagons.~
@298  = ~Everyone knows about Waukeen's Promenade and the majestic buildings in the Government District and people come and go by the docks, but few venture into heart of the city.~
@299  = ~The River District offer many fine restaurants and a classy casino where one can enjoy many table games from across Faerûn.~
@300  = ~The Guards District is where all the city guards live. Understandably, it is one of the safest districts to live in.~
@301  = ~The Scepter District, is currently the most popular place for nobles to buy their mansions because of the proximity to the Water Gardens. Several prominent Cowled Wizards also live there, including Lucious.~
@302  = ~The Gem District is the wealthiest place in the city. The only downfall of living there is that you are across the river and therefore, far away from the Water Gardens, but the splendid fountains and marble statues more than make up for that.~
@303  = ~The Wave District, is where the rich go to enjoy the boardwalk. There you will find the Golden Dragonne Theatre and Moonhall ,a seven-sided conical temple to Selûne. High Priestess and Lunar Aryn Gallowglass, an aged half-sister of the tyrant Ernest Gallowglass of Tethyr, is a shrewd business woman with three trade ships to her name.~
@304  = ~The Quill District is a good for adventurers to go to get their stories chronicled. If you are lucky, you can have Volo, himself, write down your tales of wonder into a complete compilation to sell as a book.~
@305  = ~The Trades District is where locals go to get their essential goods. Many merchants still use the barter system there.~
@306  = ~I'm so sad that services were cancelled this morning at the Lathander church.  It seems that one of their acolytes has disappeared.  How dreadful!~
@307  = ~And just when I thought I was going to have some time to relax, a huge silver sphere appears out of nowhere and crushes some homes in the Slums. The life of a council member is not an easy one.~
@308  = ~"Methinks thou dost protest too much." Aye, I can quote the poets too.  If you must protest, I respond only to hunger strikes and, even then, too late.~
@309  = ~Talos' mercy! The wind blew all my forms away! Now I will have to re-do them over the next three months!~
@310  = ~My father was born with a title, but he demanded that people distinguish themselves through deeds. He obeyed etiquette, but he did not hide his distaste for it.~
@311  = ~My daughter just became involved a fish merchant. I think she could do far better.~
@312  = ~My son just became a squire at the Order of the Radiant Heart! I'm so proud of him!~
@313  = ~What is your daughter's name?~
@314  = ~What is your son's name?~
@315  = ~Her name is Lady Veronica Songsteel. You have probably seen her with her friends around the Water Gardens, spending platinum as if it grew on trees.~
@316  = ~By the storm-crown of Talos, I don't know what she sees in that fish merchant! Perhaps I will send her away to our winter estate in Neverwinter until she forgets about him.~
@317  = ~His name is Melvin Songsteel, although now he is know simply as Squire Melvin.~
@318  = ~He may have just started, but he already feels brave enough to fight a tarrasque.~
@319  = ~Ah yes, you must be the hero of the Sword Coast that my niece, Héloïse of Crimmor, is so fond of speaking of.~
@320  = ~Do relax yourself, Lady Jwennilyn provides the best comforts for her guests.~
@321  = ~Your niece tells me that you will not allow her to fall in love.~
@322  = ~Tell me, are you fond of castrating men?~
@323  = ~I'm sorry, I must be on my way.~
@324  = ~I must say, I thought it to be a bit rude how you just walked away like that before, but seeing as how you are a sword swinger and not a nobleman, I forgive your bad manners.~
@325  = ~AS I was saying, you are the hero of the Sword Coast that my niece, Héloïse of Crimmor, is so fond of speaking of.~
@326  = ~Excuse me once again.~
@327  = ~Has she told you about this fool, Lord Abelard that she intends to wed? The man is a buffoon!~
@328  = ~You should hear him lecturing at the university.. Speaking as if he were so important. Who is he to question the nature of the gods?~
@329  = ~All the same, I think you should let her decide who she wants to fall in love with.~
@330  = ~She wants you to stay out of her business, old man!~
@331  = ~Actually this, Abelard, sounds like a real dupe.~
@332  = ~Indeed..~
@333  = ~I am her uncle, and as such I am charged with the care and responsibility of my niece while she studies and the university. I am her legal guardian and must protect her from men like that slime ball professor!~
@334  = ~In the future, I would prefer that you stayed out of these affairs.~
@335  = ~I doubt she would say something as imbecilic as that.. No doubt this is the work Abelard.~
@336  = ~See how he poisons her mind? No, I will not bend on this matter.~
@337  = ~Good day to you.~
@338  = ~The nerve of some people I tell you!~
@339  = ~Just because you are the famous adventurer that defeated Sarevok and saved the Sword Coast, it does not give you the right to interfere in the family business of others!~
@340  = ~Were it not for your high standing within the community I would have you arrested for bothering me. Regardless, I forbid you to ever speak with me on the subject again. Is that understood?~
@341  = ~I am a canon of the seven-sided Moonhall of Selûne. Since you come from a peasant background, allow me to explain what that means.~
@342  = ~A canon is an ecclesiastical position but also an administrative and executive one as well. Canons are men of influence and power in their parish neighborhood.~
@343  = ~That is how I was able to secure a place for my niece at the university. Usually the waiting list takes years, but with my connections in the city, I was able to speed up to process.~
@344  = ~I must say that I disagree with the way that the council is dividing up the taxes.~
@345  = ~Far too much of it goes to worthless peasants that do nothing but waste in anyhow. So much opportunity is squandered because of this reckless attitude.~
@346  = ~No, I don't think that the poor should starve to death, but how is taking gold from my pockets going to help a man that does not know the value of those coins?~
@347  = ~The rich have too much gold already! The government should force them to give some back!~
@348  = ~I think that there must be a system that will please both sides of the table.~
@349  = ~Please excuse me, I'm really not one for political discussions.~
@350  = ~Forget about the poor! What have they ever done for anyone?~
@351  = ~Oh I agree.. But before that ever happens, the rich will tire of being over-taxed and move elsewhere.~
@352  = ~Without all the gold that the nobles bring, the prices in the city would soar sky-high, and a loaf of bread would cost a regular peasant his entire life savings.~
@353  = ~I doubt that things would be as bad as you predict.~
@354  = ~So what is the answer?~
@355  = ~Are you mad? Do you know how much food I have put on the table for my servants and their families? Do you realize how many would go hungry if I had to sell a few servants to the mines because I could not afford to feed them?~
@356  = ~If you tax the rich any more, they will all leave Athkatla and the city would begin to rot from within. Crime would go unchecked and unpunished as no one could pay the guards any longer.. and before long, total chaos would rule.~
@357  = ~I must say that I was mistaken about you. I thought that perhaps because you were from a warrior background, that you would favor all the miserable serfs that work the land.~
@358  = ~The truth is, the reason they are peasants is because that is all they are good for. Not everyone can run a merchant guild or be a canon at an important city temple.~
@359  = ~Yes.. I should have known. You warriors are good for swinging swords and casting magic, but running a city is beyond your grasp.~
@360  = ~Political debate is only for the truly gifted of mind. People enlightened enough to entertain ideas without agreeing to them.~
@361  = ~That is easy.. The people should be taxed for the grain that feeds them.~
@362  = ~Have you traveled outside of the Water Gardens as of late? Nothing more then a pack of thieves out there!~
@363  = ~If that is a preview of the council has in store for the rest of us, count me out.~
@364  = ~I am so disgusted with that Abelard!~
@365  = ~All he seems to be doing these days is writing love letters to my niece, Héloïse, instead of teaching the students, whose parents have given large sums of gold coins to attend the university.~
@366  = ~If he continues on like this, I fear that he may come across some tragic fate. Powerful nobles will not sit idly bye while some charlatan impregnates their daughters and then runs off with their gold.~
@367  = ~Men have been castrated for much less, I tell you.~
@368  = ~Now that you have seen both cities, which do you prefer? Baldur's Gate.. or Athkatla?~
@369  = ~I prefer the countryside to any city.~
@370  = ~Both are equally beautiful.~
@371  = ~I prefer Baldur's Gate.~
@372  = ~I Like Athkatla.~
@373  = ~Hmmm.. yes, you do seem like are a better fit in the backwoods than the Water Gardens. The property is less expensive as well, so I'm sure that even a warrior like you could afford a modest cottage somewhere near the Umar Hills.~
@374  = ~You may have to deal with a few ogre attacks, but after you deal with a winter there, that won't seem so bad.~
@375  = ~It seems that you warriors often have trouble making up your minds. That must be why you wear those helmets indoors, yes?~
@376  = ~Hahaha! NO seriously! Who comes to a dinner party in the Water Gardens dressed in armor and armed with weapons? I must say.. So utterly tacky!~
@377  = ~Ahhh.. Baldur's Gate! I was only a young boy when my father took us there the first time when we visited the Sword Coast. Much less kobolds back then..~
@378  = ~The city itself was rather boring. There are few temples of majestic beauty like in Athkatla and the slums seem to go on forever. The best gambling hall in on the Low Lantern, a ship in the harbor, which although being a fine establishment, the fact that Baldur's Gate does not have a casino in the city proper just screams low class.~
@379  = ~No.. What I always enjoyed of the Sword Coast was the rustic country side. Candlekeep, Beregost and Friendly Arm Inn were always more preferable than the city itself to me.~
@380  = ~Somehow I knew that our pearl would capture your imagination. Although, who is not taken back when they first see the Promenade in the City of Coin?~
@381  = ~It is unfortunate that you are a warrior and therefore are not free to do what you with your time for there is much of the city that you will probably miss.~
@382  = ~The Dome of the Rose, is a monastery and temple to Lathander. It is a significant religious structure located in the city's Gem District. Mornmaster Thaddin Dawnhunter, a quiet priest with little inclination to mercantilism, oversees the other priests, monks, and followers. The three-story temple hall is capped with a dome of rose tinted glass that glows at dawn during morning song and prayer services.~
@383  = ~Moonhall is a seven-sided conical temple to Selûne in the Wave District located near the waterfront. High Priestess and Lunar Aryn Gallowglass, an aged half-sister of the tyrant Ernest Gallowglass of Tethyr, is a shrewd business woman with three trade ships to her name. She plows back most of her profits into the temple fund.~
@384  = ~Ahh.. and let us not forget the university here in Athkatla. A beacon of knowledge for the entire city. Yes, it is good to live the life of a noble and have the freedom to go where one pleases. Not be be one some god-forsaken quest every moment of the day..~
@385  = ~At least make sure you try the wine at the Blue Unicorn before heading back into the Slums. They have any excellent selection there.~
@386  = ~Or try the new place, the Red Lion. I like what they did with that spot there. The old store they had there looked more like some run down shack you would find in a village up North that what you would expect here in the Water Gardens.~
@387  = ~By now I am sure that you have noticed the three beautiful women outside, Ladies Veronica Songsteel, Ravhana Shieldheart, and Aliella Sapphiredge, the daughter of Lord Trakas Sapphiredge. Lady Jwennilyn Goldsword cannot stand being around them.~
@388  = ~Rumor has it that Lady Sapphiredge bad mouthed the Kara-Turan cuisine at one of Lady Goldsword's dinner party some time ago. The word got out and she has been blacklisted along with her two friends.~
@389  = ~It could also be that the Goldswords are competing with the Sapphiredges for the trading rights in many of the costal cities of Maztica. Whatever the case though, I think it is a shame.~
@390  = ~That Lady Shieldheart is quite a catch. I would fancy a a night with her, I would.~
@391  = ~Ugh! Lady Matila has been giving me the hungry eyes all night! What scares me is that she gets very aggressive when she drinks wine!~
@392  = ~I made a mistake with her once.. one that I have regretted ever since. I should not have drunk that much that night!~
@393  = ~Oi! Is she looking this way? I am telling you, that woman will not leave me alone ever since that night.~
@394  = ~Why use platinum, well I will tell you...~
@395  = ~You see, the mining operations in places like Keczulla and Eshpurta will soon be flooding the streets with a bunch of cheap gold that they have mined from the mountains. Prices of goods will go up to compensate for this and the value of gold will go down as a consequence.~
@396  = ~Because platinum is such a rare metal and so rarely used for coins, the value of platinum coins will not be affected by this flood of gold. Nobles with large supplies of platinum will be able to buy up tons of gold very cheaply and store it away.~
@397  = ~Eventually the price of gold will go back to what is was prior to the gold rush and you would have made a fortune. Gold is the marker of wealth for the poor man, my friend.~
@398  = ~That's why I suggest that to change some of your gold coins into platinum and keep them stored away. One day, when the crisis hits, you will be better prepared than most other people if you follow my advice.~
@399  = ~The university here is the best in all of Amn with a library that houses over one million books and scrolls in it.~
@400  = ~Do you see yourself seek higher education one day?~
@401  = ~I don't think that university is for me.~
@402  = ~I would love to attend the university.~
@403  = ~I'm sorry, I haven't the time for this.~
@404  = ~Of course not.. I should have know that a warrior who spends his time running around in armor and fighting trolls with sword and magic could not appreciate the finer points of academia.~
@405  = ~If you can afford the two hundred thousand gold coins that it costs per year, I would advise that you attend. It is a once in a lifetime experience that not many have the pleasure of taking part of.~
@406  = ~The library has books that detail the entire history of Faerun and the classrooms are all made of marble with oak desks. The professors are all top class as well. In fact every year, the university sends out scribes to seek out the wisest men of all Abeir-Toril!~
@407  = ~Many great leaders have attended the university throughout the years as well. Including many of the members of the council. It just goes to show that higher learning will lead you down a road that leads to better places.~
@408  = ~I refuse to speak to any group that keeps a drow amongst them.~
@409  = ~I am Firebead Elvenhair. We met before in Candlekeep and again in Beregost.~
@410  = ~That is one crazy name you have there.~
@411  = ~Yes, what do you want?~
@412  = ~How have you been?~
@413  = ~That is not important at the moment.~
@414  = ~Now is not the time for amusement.~

@416  = ~Let me be brief.. This demon has been collecting books owned by mages, book with magical power in them. With enough of these books, this devil could open a portal that would allow hordes of demons to invade Faerûn!~
@417  = ~I will follow if you deem it necessary, but this devil must be stopped at all costs! Lead the way, Child of Bhaal. I will be your ally in this battle!~
@418  = ~So it is done. The demon has been slain and Faerûn has been saved from a terrible fate. Thank you <CHARNAME>. Your heroic deed has saved the lives of thousands. ~

@454  = ~Ahh, yes.. Right about now, my beautiful wife, Krystin, should be sneaking up the stairs behind you, locking into our little trap.~ [SLYTH01]
@455  = ~Hehehe.. Like sheep to the slaughter! You probably only remember us from when we were working for Sarevok, but we have improved our killing skills tenfold since then.~

@457  = ~Ohh.. I'm so excited Slythe, I've never heard real life heroes beg for their lives, hehe.~ [KRYST01]
@458  = ~You're all going to die! I'm going to slit your throats, open up your guts and spoon out your brains.~ [KRYST03]
@459  = ~I wish more of these merchants dealt in platinum. It is hard enough for a lady like myself to get around the city without having to carry a bundle of gold coins with her.~
@460  = ~Not that a warrior-peasant like you cares about such thing. No.. the only thing that matters to you is how many gold coins the next goblin is carrying. Dear Mystra, how do you stand to live in such a wayward fashion? I think I would die if I did not have my servants to do my hair for me.~
@461  = ~Mmm... I'd rather not think about. I rather just get one of these noblemen to buy me another drink.~ [ACT_03E]
@462  = ~Is there actually anything that I can use the platinum coins for?~
@463  = ~I have enough platinum coins to make even a wench like you drool with glee.~
@464  = ~I think that platinum coins are a waste of time.~
@465  = ~You should learn to buy your own drinks.~
@466  = ~I would not expect you to understand as you come from a peasant background, but platinum is what separates rich people from really rich people. Any noble can buy a gold mine these days. It takes a great effort and connections to gather platinum coins though. Luckily we are spoiled here in the water Gardens in that regard.~
@467  = ~Besides, many merchants will only sell their more rare items for platinum coins. Ever fancy a pair of golden pantaloons?~
@468  = ~Oh, leave me alone. I am only using what the gods gave me.~
@469  = ~The way I see it, I am only using their blessing for my personal gain would be a sin! Men use their rank and position in life to acquire power. Why is it wrong for a women to use her gifts?~
@470  = ~Besides, drinks are expensive here!~
@471  = ~I have enough platinum coins to make even a wench like you drool with glee. ~
@472  = ~That will take more platinum than even an adventurer as famous as you could gather, to get me excited. I am after all not some brainless debutante that will grovel at the feet of any wealthy merchant.~
@473  = ~I will have you know that my family's wealth goes back generations, and comes with certain respects. ~
@474  = ~Well! If you don't mind, I've an important luncheon I must get to and I do not intend to tell my guests that I was late because some roustabouts were pestering me for attention. What is it you want? *sigh* Yes, I have wasted enough time talking to you.~
@475  = ~I just hope those cute noblemen in the corner did not think that I was with you or anything like that.~
@476  = ~I am originally from Trademeet and came here to Athkatla to study at the university. The first thing that surprised me was the amount of beggars in the city.~
@477  = ~My first night here, I went with a few other classmates to the Sea's Bounty in the Docks.. a mistake I shan't be making again. The streets were filled with prostitutes and dirty pirates. I thought I could catch a disease just from breathing the air!~
@478  = ~Even the Government and Temple districts are filled with nothing but nasty beggars and annoying gnomish vendors. Honestly, the only places that I like here in Athkatla other then the Water Gardens are the Wave District and the Gem District.~
@479  = ~I would never be caught dead in the Copper Coronet, or the entire Slums for that matter. Too many beggars and thieves.~
@480  = ~The Bridge District is even worse from what I hear. They say people are skinned alive and tortured slowly to death during the night. *gasp* I can't even imagine! The indignity! Thank goodness that I reside here in the Water Gardens where such grotesque things could never happen. Well.. almost never.~
@481  = ~My father wants me to have an arranged marriage with a nobleman from a powerful family to strengthen our position, but I don't want to at all. I would rather marry for true love.. Or maybe I'll find someone cute around here.~
@482  = ~Pehllus Tanislove and Lord Milsire Donderbeg are know to come here some nights. If I could get either, I would be sitting in diamonds and riches for the rest of my life.~
@483  = ~One of my suitors bought me a fur coat from the winnings he made betting in the Battle Pit fights. Personally, I detest such mindless violence, although it seems that the rewards can be nice at times.~ [ACT_03E]
@484  = ~Maybe tonight I'll find a noblemen to buy me ring to match my fur coat with the platinum he makes from Salvatore's Lottery.~
@485  = ~I hear that they have a troll chef working in the backrooms, but they might just say that to sell more ale and wine.~
@486  = ~I don't know though.. Perhaps I'll sneak back there and see for myself. Or maybe the servant girl could tell me?~
@487  = ~Mmm.. the food is so good, even if a troll was cooking it, I don't think I would care. You have try the red squid. They say it comes all the way from Maztica.~
@488  = ~Now where is that serving girl? Ugh! Good help is so hard to find nowadays.~
@489  = ~Rrrr.. my studies have me on edge right now. I'm so far behind in my elven! Fae, Faen, Faer! Ohhh So much pressure. And then my history of Athkatla presentation is way behind schedule.~
@490  = ~I wish I had it easy like Héloïse.. That I could just flip my hair and batter my eyes and pass all my exams.. But no, not all of us can be involved in scandalous love affair with our professors.~
@491  = ~Anyhow... Have I told you that once a year, the Lolipop Guild books all the rooms up stairs for their convention? The damn halflings make so much noise, what with all the singing and dancing. Were in not for the splendid quality of their candy treats and the catchiness of their songs, it would not be worth it!~
@492  = ~Do you enjoy music, peasant? I find that the poor are so often much more colorful when it comes to music than us of the noble class.~
@493  = ~Here they have this amazing kobold singer, Deekin Scalesinger, I believe his name is.. Anyways, he is really fantastic. It's not like that music that you are probably used to, but I love it.~
@494  = ~Do you play any music? Oh, I'm sorry.. Look at who I'm asking.. I could just die!~
@495  = ~What? Is it strange for you to see a noblewoman out without being accompanied by a man? Such an archaic way of thought!~
@496  = ~I'll have you know that the top student at the university, is Lady Héloïse, a woman from a very distinguished family from Crimmor.~
@497  = ~Rumor has it though, that she has been having a scandalous affair with the headmaster, Lord Abelard. They think that nobody knows, but the whole university is talking about it.~
@498  = ~I would just hate to see what happens to Lord Abelard if Lady Héloïse's Uncle Fulbert finds out about it! You didn't hear anything from me though.~
@499  = ~I bought a painting from one of those street urchins that comes from the Slums. He assured me that it was one of a kind.. A masterpiece!~
@500  = ~He gave me a real deal too.. only four hundred platinum coins. Ha! Stupid brat! I should have turned him into the guards for selling stolen artwork, but the quality is so good and the price so unbeatable, I could not let the opportunity pass me bye.~ [ACT_03E]
@501  = ~Anyhow, I think I'll have a few drinks before heading back to the dormitory to study. My exams are coming up soon and I want to be ready.~
@502  = ~Four hundred platinum coins!? I bought the same painting for much less!~
@503  = ~Quite a deal if you ask me.~
@504  = ~No, no, you must be mistaken. You see, the eye of the peasant is not as discerning when it comes to fine art like the eye of a noble.~
@505  = ~It takes class and knowledge to appreciate a masterpiece. Neither of which, you have.~
@506  = ~If I were not so nice, I would give you a swift backhand for speaking to me in that manner.~
@507  = ~Shut your mouth, wench!~
@508  = ~And what would a peasant like you know about savings? Ha! You probably still shop at the dreadful Adventurers Mart in the Promenade.~
@509  = ~Just because some dragon died of old age and you happen to be around to collect its horde, does not mean that you are some kind of upper class-men.~
@510  = ~I know more about saving gold than a spoiled noble brat like you!~
@511  = ~The dragon did not die of old age, it died of exposure.~
@512  = ~Anyways, I am not one to gossip, but those two mangy dogs with Caratacus are nothing more than gold-digging sluts!~
@513  = ~They walk around the Water Gardens like they are important, but the truth is they are nothing more than merchant class noble brats. All they ever do is cheat during their university exams, drink and smoke black lotus. They really need to learn their lesson.~
@514  = ~*sigh* I remember the days when the Blue Unicorn was only for the glitterati of Athkatla. Ever since Lady Goldsword started doing her dinner parties though, this places clientele has taken a turn for the worse.~
@515  = ~Have you eaten at the Dragon restaurant in the Promenade yet? I still haven't, can you believe it?~
@516  = ~I want to go, but between wizard's destroying the place and the circus going wild, it's been a place that I have avoided as of late. Maybe that will change later though.~
@517  = ~Anything is better then eating at another boring dinner in the Government District. They are all snooty old farts that don't know how to have a good time.~
@518  = ~The real place to be now is the dinner parties that Lady Goldsword throws, but only the most elite of the glitterati get invited to those. Even Elminster is on the waiting list.~
@519  = ~Oh yes, she is very well respected amongst the nobility, unlike those Argrims. They epitomize what I hate about nobles. Everyone is beneath their status, and if you wish any respect you must be of their social number.~
@520  = ~What do you recommend that I eat at the Dragon Restaurant?~
@521  = ~Why does everyone dislike the Argrims?~
@522  = ~Ever heard of a place named the The Lusty Dagger Tavern?~
@523  = ~The roasted wyvern is good, although it is a bit rough and greasy.~
@524  = ~If you really want a treat though, ask for a Ice cream dragon and mojito dragon. *wink-wink* I promise that you will enjoy those.~
@525  = ~For all the reason that I have mentioned and more. They are a den of snakes.~
@526  = ~The only thing they care for is wealth and power and they care not if they crush the dreams of thousands to get them.~
@527  = ~It is a popular tavern on the south side of the Marketplace that specializes in exotic tastes and wild parties.~
@528  = ~I have been there before on many occasions, but now I much prefer the tranquility and safety of the Water Gardens.~
@529  = ~By the gods! A black elf, here? What is the meaning of this?~
@530  = ~We are more often treacherous through weakness than through calculation.~
@531  = ~Believe those who are seeking the truth. Doubt those who find it.~
@532  = ~Even a clock that does not work is right twice a day.~
@533  = ~If a man who cannot count finds a four-leaf clover, is he lucky?~

@655  = ~You really ought to check your facts before you accuse a member of a respected family like the Roenalls of a crime like that.~
@656  = ~Why, because he is so agressive with his woman or because of his flashy style? Did he take your woman?~
@657  = ~Please! The man is an idiot that would not know what to do with a woman if he was given a manual.~
@658  = ~Because he is an arrogant asshole who should be slapped in the face!~
@659  = ~Quite frankly I find his style rather tacky.~
@660  = ~I heard that he is a smuggler.~
@661  = ~Just be careful what you say about my brother.~
@662  = ~He is after all an officer in the army and could have you gagged and imprisoned without trial on a whim.~
@663  = ~The Roenalls are not a family that takes accusations such as those lightly.~
@664  = ~Stand back commoner, I have no copper for you! My lord, the streets is crawling with you warrior adventurers these days.~
@665  = ~It seems that everyone that I speak to in a tavern these days wants to join up on some epic quest, even if they haven't the slightest idea of where they are going.~
@666  = ~*sigh* And the council is mad, putting all these extra taxes on trade! How is an ordinary person supposd to pay for all his servants? I tell you if things don't change soon, rebellion might come about. The nobles can only take so much. It is not fair that our hard earned gold goes to pay for bread for beggars with no ambition in life but to see another day.~
@667  = ~I think I would be better if we got rid of all the filthy bastards, the the council would never approve that.~
@668  = ~You peasants have no idea the trouble that we nobles have to go through to ensure that our lands are well protected just so that you can do your ploughing and harvesting.~
@669  = ~You there, do you want a job? I swear the steward that runs my lands is a complete imbecile! All he has to do is take care of the wine-presses and collect the chickens and eggs that the serfs contribute every year and he cannot even do that right!~
@670  = ~That no good Salvatore took me for ten thousand gold coins tonight! I swear that I shall not gamble on that lottery of his for at least a month!~
@671  = ~Gambling on the gladiators is another matter altogether.~
@672  = ~Mmmm... yes, I think I will have some mulberry wine to go along with the newly-salted smoked sausage that I had my servant purchase at the Unicorn.~
@673  = ~They say that there is a chef that cooks all the food inside the Blue Unicorn!~
@674  = ~Personally I find the notion ridiculous to think that a mangy beast like a troll could cook such exquisite food. It is to laugh!~
@675  = ~I have yet to be invited to one of the Goldsword's dinner parties. I am beginning to think that something I said must have offended Lady Jwennilyn.~
@676  = ~Perhaps having a few dozen roses brought to her house by one of my servants will alleviate the situation?~
@677  = ~I hear Lady Elgea is going to be there tonight. Alas, since I am not invited, I will miss her.~
@678  = ~Perhaps I should have some of my servants perform a love sonnet outside of the balcony later .. to show her how I feel.~
@679  = ~What do you know about a cult run by Lord Kevril Slyther?~
@680  = ~Do you know anything useful about Lady Goldsword?~
@681  = ~That sounds like a stupid idea.~
@682  = ~Get out of my way, you slime!~
@683  = ~Well, what do you know? You are just a peasant anyways.~
@684  = ~Why does every adventurer that saves a village of farmers think that the nobility should care what they think?~
@685  = ~Lord Slyther? Cult? Ummm.. Nothing, nothing at all.~
@686  = ~I don know where you are getting your information, but I have absolutely no knowledge of orgies where people are fed to snakes in a crypt in the Bridge District.~
@687  = ~Only that she is the most sought after woman in all the Water Gardens! There is not a noblemen here that would not hand over a chest full of platinum to spend just one night with her.~
@688  = ~That is why I am so upset that she is no longer inviting me to her dinner parties. I don't know what I could have done to make myself part of the black list? Perhaps it was those jokes I was telling that night. Hardly my fault though, the wine was very strong.~
@689  = ~Or maybe she found out about the purple lotus I gave to Paris in exchange for a staute of me.~
@690  = ~Well! I expect people to have such manners in Baldur's Gate, but not here in the Water Gardens!~
@691  = ~Are you not <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep? You and your companions certainly match the description. Yes, it is you! It has been some time since I saw at my summer manor in Nashkel, but I still recognize your face.~
@692  = ~Well, on behalf of everyone I know, I'd like to thank you for what you've done.  If it weren't for your heroics......well I shudder to think how a war with Amn would have turned out.  Hopefully you gave that villainous Sarevok what he deserved.~
@693  = ~In case you are wondering, I broke it off with Jamie after that incident in the closet.~
@694  = ~Anyhow, I see you have come to the Water Gardens. How very wise of you.~
@695  = ~Aside from the Scepter District, where I own a spacious apartment as well, this is the most fantastic part of the city.~
@696  = ~What's this? A black elf?~
@697  = ~I shall have to keep a better eye on my coin purse.~
@698  = ~The Water Gardens is one of the few places in the city where people of nobility can feel safe walking around at night.~
@699  = ~Where does one go around here to have a good time?~
@700  = ~So this place is richer than the Government District?~
@701  = ~Can you tell me which of the cobblestone roads leads where?~
@702  = ~The Blue Unicorn is always a good time. Prices are a bit expensive, but you look like you have brought in a nice haul selling goblin bows.~
@703  = ~Other than that, you could get yourself invited to one of Lady Goldsword's dinner parties.~
@704  = ~All the most fabulous guest are their including the upper echelon of noblity, royalty and glitterati like Elminster and Volo.~
@705  = ~There is a new place that just opened up, the Red Lion. It seems that the woman that had the weapon store there have teamed up with Alfons the Tax Collector to make the place really nice.~
@706  = ~The food and drink are not on par with what they offer at the Blue Unicorn, but the ladies upstairs have just brought over a whole shipment of rare spell scrolls from Waterdeep that might be interesting for an adventurer like yourself.~
@707  = ~Take a look at the luxurious villas and apartments here in the Water Gardens and tell me that this place is not nicer by a tenfold.~
@708  = ~The Government District is classic, but the Water Gardens has a modern feel to it. Plus the crowd here is much younger, mostly university students.~
@709  = ~That is another interesting aspect of it, because you have so many different young nobles from all over Faerûn in one place. Makes for interesting conversation.~
@710  = ~Now, If you are talking about the Government District West Side, that is another matter altogether.~
@711  = ~There you have the Dragon's End and the Silverale Hall Festhall, which are both my favorite places to have a drink when I am on that side of the Bridge.~
@712  = ~Do I look like a servant to you? *sigh* One never asks a lady directions! I swear, you adventurers have such terrible manners! Try finding a servant somewhere and ask them.~
@713  = ~Anyways, it is very a nice night for stargazing. I think I shall have a few more drinks and then visit the new observatory they just built in the Government District. I sure that Orion won't mind, especially now that his beloved is gone.~
@714  = ~I beg your pardon! One does not barge off when speaking to a noble unless properly dismissed.~
@715  = ~I made over four hundred platinum coins playing the Lottery!~
@716  = ~I wonder what I am going to buy myself with the winnings?~
@717  = ~Go on.. You should try your it too. Who knows, you might win enough coins to buy yourself a luxury apartment here in the Water Gardens.~ [ACT_03E]
@718  = ~Is there actually anything useful that I can actually use these platinum coins on?~
@719  = ~Where can I play the lottery?~
@720  = ~Have any luck numbers?~
@721  = ~Sevens and sixes always seem to come up for me.~
@722  = ~The trick is to never give up, alternate between even and odd numbers and have lots of disposable gold that you are willing to lose.~
@723  = ~You can purchase some fine tailored clothing. I've never been satisfied with the dresses made by Elma Spitwrack in the River District. The workmanship is shoddy and the material is coarse. I've never understood why she is considered so highly by the fashion establishment in Waterdeep. I think that a blind goblin could make a better dress. Anyhow, a gentlemen doesn't go to one of Lady Jwennilyn Goldsword's dinner parties without a pair of golden pantaloons and those can only be bought with platinum.~
@724  = ~There is another merchant, Jasper Thumbdragon I think his name is.. thats sells special amulets of protection that are all the rage with the ladies right now. However, being that you are a famous adventurer, you are probably more interested in weapons and armor and the like.~
@725  = ~I hear that on the second floor of the Blue Unicorn, there is a dwarven merchant that sells powerful weapons, but only deals in platinum.~
@726  = ~Go to backroom on the first floor of the Blue Unicorn and speak to the man there named, Salvatore. He will ask you to place bet on a number between one and seven and then throw a small bouncing ball onto a stack of skulls and numbered chalices until the ball lands into one goblets.~
@727  = ~Even though it is not decent for me to mingle with those beneath my station, I find that you possess a certain irresistible charm.  I am willing to tell whatever you wish to hear.  Perhaps you'd like to know about the last ball I attended.  It was wondrous, I was at the forefront of everyone's mind.~
@728  = ~Lady Jwennilyn Goldsword has been hosting dinner parties at her new summer villa here in the Water Gardens, inviting all the most prestigious people in the city. I went to a few, but I found that Lord Abelard to be simply annoying what with all his philosophies on life and love.~
@729  = ~I have been to one of Lady Goldsword's parties and find them rather boring.~
@730  = ~I hear that Elminster and Volo sometimes attend those dinner parties.~
@731  = ~What can you tell me about Lord Abelard?~
@732  = ~Well, his relationship with his student, Lady Héloïse is probably the worst kept secret in the Water Gardens and yet her Uncle Fulbert, a man that dedicates himself to being informed of all the recent happenings does not have a clue.~
@733  = ~I fear for Lord Abelard's safety should Fulbert find out. Fulbert has powerful friends amongst both the council and the Cowled Wizards.~
@734  = ~It is also said that he secretly employs the government assassin know as the Harlequin, although that could just be a baseless rumor.~
@735  = ~Yes, I have had the pleasure of meeting them both. Elminster was quite dashing, obviously born of royalty. Volo on the other hand, I fand rather odd.~
@736  = ~He was always so busy with a quill and parchment, going on about a series of guide books that he was writing for people traveling throughout Faerûn. I must say, I found it all rather dull.~
@737  = ~That is because you are a boorish adventurer and don't really understand the sophisticated things.~
@738  = ~I been there where she filled her pool with liquor and of course there was the time she filled the room with haystacks with spellglow moonlight on them and let the nobles.~
@739  = ~I missed the party she had where she bought a caged giant spider and had it spin a web throughout the entire villa so that they can could chase each other around on them!~
@740  = ~I've heard quite a bit about what's been going on around town.  Most of the talk's about iron, and so quite boring really. However, I really want to see the Flying Elephants at the circus.~
@741  = ~I wonder if they have resolved whatever problems they were having?~
@742  = ~Why is it that I have never seen any elephants at the circus?~
@743  = ~Do you have any idea what is going on inside the circus?~
@744  = ~I have taken care of that problem already.~
@745  = ~The flying elephant spectacular is a special show that they only do once in a while and tickets are very expensive.~
@746  = ~With the recent problems though, I would not be surprised if the show is put on hiatus for a while.~
@747  = ~The city guard has the tent sealed off and nobody is allowed to enter and adventurer groups have gone it, trying to solve the problem, only to never return.~
@748  = ~If you ask me, the Cowled Wizards are up to no good. Why else have they not been called in to stop the problem?~
@749  = ~Well, it is about time! After what I heard that you did at the Nashkel Carnival, I thought a minor problem at the circus would be no problem for you.~
@750  = ~I always wanted to go to the Sea's Bounty one night, but I dare not because of the things that I have heard. My servants tell me that a gang of bandits named the 'Shadow Thieves' operates in the docks here in Athkatla.~
@751  = ~I also heard that the latest caravan bringing beauty supplies from the East was ransacked by ogres!~
@752  = ~Those filty beasts! I need my vanishing cream!~
@753  = ~Ugh! When is the council going to force the poor to join the army and expel these monsters from our lands? Every day that they wait, another caravan gets raided.~
@754  = ~And I wonder when those lazy workers are going to get started fixing that corner of the promenade already! What, it been almost a lifetime already!!~
@755  = ~That is the problem with the way the council is running things. Their is no incentive for workers to to a good job if you hand them free gold for doing nothing anyways.~
@756  = ~The books for my classes at the university are so expensive!~
@757  = ~Father tried to talk me into buying used books instead, but I convinced him that my education deserved only the best.~
@758  = ~The exams have been tough so far, but luckily I have Héloïse in a few of my classes and me and her have become quite friendly over the past year.~
@759  = ~Suffice it to say that because of her relationship with our professor, Lord Abelard, she always has the correct answers.~
@760  = ~By the way, you really must listen to the music of Deekin Scalesinger while you are here in the Water Gardens. He performs at the Blue Unicorn, just behind me.~
@761  = ~Best music I have ever heard and I have traveled far and wide!!~
@762  = ~Maybe those kobold fingers of his touch the strings a little differently.. I don't know.~
@763  = ~Oh my! I always wanted to bed a handsome knight like you.~
@764  = ~How would you like t come back to my palace and suck on my breasts?~
@765  = ~Ha! You'll find that the tongue of a noblewoman such as mine is very refined.~
@766  = ~But you should see what I can do with my mouth.~
@767  = ~Ooohhh you are Kara-Turan, are you not?~
@768  = ~Kara-Turan with a spicy attitude... What an exotic dish!~
@769  = ~You must let me Mommy Matilda have a taste some time.~
@770  = ~Mmmm.. a wizard! I just love intellectual men.~
@771  = ~Why don't you come back to my place an entertain me with a spell of shocking hands?~
@772  = ~Oh no you dont! You are not getting away that easily!~
@773  = ~Come on now, don't be shy. I'm not a rough lover... except when I'm on top.~
@774  = ~Ohhh! How are you doing, little man?~
@775  = ~Is that a turnip in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?~
@776  = ~Well give it here, lover, so that we can get cooking!~
@777  = ~If you take my meaning.. *wink* *wink*~
@778  = ~Mmm.. such a strong, hard body.~
@779  = ~Tell me something, would you, nature boy?~
@780  = ~Have you ever made passionate love in the moonlight?~
@781  = ~Mmm... you are that actor everyone is talking about! Ohhh! So handsome!~
@782  = ~Why don't you come back to my villa with me? I have a role that you can play?~
@783  = ~Oh come now, don't be shy!~
@784  = ~I know! Why don't we practice that scene where you kiss the fair maiden?~
@785  = ~If it is not a shining knight in armor.~
@786  = ~Tell me darling, have you a sonnet for a lady of elegance such as myself?~
@787  = ~Doesn't my beauty give you inspiration?~
@788  = ~Ohhhh... what a fine muscled Rashemi! Come here darling, let Matilda show you the meaning of real pleasure.~
@789  = ~What a cute little critter you have there. I have just the place where you can put him!~
@790  = ~Well if it is not, Valygar Corthala! Still unwed, aye?~
@791  = ~I hear you don't like magic, but maybe that is because you have not known the magic of my supple breats.~
@792  = ~Oooohhh, you are that fancy singer that everyone is talking about... Gerrick of the Dale Wind Troubadours.~
@793  = ~Yes.. a bit thin for my tastes, but that is nothing that some cheese and salted pork will not cure. Oh yes! I will fix you up something tasty for you! Hahahaha!~
@794  = ~I have always been fascinated with your type, kind sir.. Afterall, you know what they say about dwarves with thick beards, don't you?~
@795  = ~So, we are into the whole vampire and biting thing, are we? Mmmm... I find that terribly sexy.~
@796  = ~Tell me, do you think that I could be your, Queen of the Undead?~
@797  = ~Ooooh! Now are you not the cutest little dwarf that I have ever seen! Why don't you come back with me to my villa so that you can tickle me with peacock feathers.~
@798  = ~I just love how you dwarves always act so strong and tough. It make me melt with desire!~
@799  = ~Well, aren't you a scrumptious snack.. I could always use another servant to help me satisfy my needs and I am sure there is a hole you can fill.~
@800  = ~Ohhh.. I just love adventurers! Mmm.. so big and strong!~
@801  = ~Don't be shy, I promise I'll be gentle.~
@802  = ~Mmm.. You are handsome enough, but I wonder how long your sword is.~
@803  = ~Away with you, commoner! I am on the look out for a nice handsome servant boy to take home with me.~
@804  = ~Just the thought makes me want to die a little.~
@805  = ~The thickness of the beard don't mean shale! It's the motion of yer Stalagmite that counts!~
@806  = ~I left all this noise and crowds for very good reasons.  I'm beginning to remember them.~ [VALYGA42]
@807  = ~Ummm... actually the name is Garrick, and I am no longer with the Dale Wind Troubadours.~
@808  = ~Brave Sir Garrick has chosen to flee this battle!~
@809  = ~I've had better times drownin' face-first in gutter-water, bleedin' from every orifice...~ [KORGAN04]
@810  = ~There be time fer this battle another day!~ [KORGAN02]
@811  = ~Well met stranger, I am Baldrek Goblinslayer from Sildëyuir in the Feywild.~
@812  = ~I have come to the Water Gardens because I have some of the most powerful magical items in Feywild for sale and I need to meet someone with enough platinum to buy them.~
@813  = ~I have a Rousing Hammer for 25,250 platinum coins, that will instill vigor in your allies.~
@814  = ~I have a Rhythm Blade for 21,250 platinum coins,that not only deals damage, it will protect you and improve your reflexes.~
@815  = ~And I have Improved Boots of Jaunting for 5,200 platinum coins, good to help to escape dangerous situations.~
@816  = ~Are you interested in any of these goods?~
@817  = ~I'd like to purchase the Rousing Hammer.~
@818  = ~I'd like to purchase the Rhythm Blade.~
@819  = ~I'd like to purchase the Improved Boots of Jaunting.~
@820  = ~I don't have platinum, but I have gold.~
@821  = ~Gold?? Gold is for commoners. No, I don't want to be carrying around piles and piles of gold with me everywhere I go. Platinum is easier to carry with you and more valuable to boot.~
@822  = ~Now, are you interested in buying something?~
@823  = ~Good choice.~ [ACT_03E]
@824  = ~Do come again when you have more platinum.~ [ACT_03E]
@825  = ~I knew you would be back. Nobody can resist the magical items of Baldrek Goblinslayer. So what's it going to be?~
@826  = ~Good news, I just got a few new items in!~
@827  = ~I have the Aftershock Weapon that will send ripples of force to nearby foes for 13,000 platinum coins.~
@828  = ~I have the Avalanche Hammer that is enchanted with the essence of elemental earth for 21,000 platinum coins.~
@829  = ~I got Time Link Armor, for 27,000 platinum coins that will let the user distort time and space.~
@830  = ~I have the Frost Fury Waraxe for 30,000 platinum coins that promises cold death with each swing.~
@831  = ~Ands as always..~
@832  = ~I have the Rousing Hammer for 25,250 platinum coins, that will instill vigor in your allies.~
@833  = ~I have the Rhythm Blade for 21,250 platinum coins,that not only deals damage, it will protect you and improve your reflexes.~
@834  = ~I'd like to purchase the Frost Fury Waraxe.~
@835  = ~I'd like to purchase the Aftershock Weapon.~
@836  = ~I'd like to purchase the Time Link Armor.~
@837  = ~I'd like to purchase the Avalanche Hammer.~

@839  = ~I have the Rousing Hammer for 31,250 platinum coins, that will instill vigor in your allies.~
@840  = ~What's this? A black elf? Here? *sigh* Seems they will let anyone in the Water Gardens these days if they have coin.~
@841  = ~Surface dwellers can be so stupid.~ [VICONI04]
@842  = ~Mmm... yes. If it isn't the de'Arnise child, Nalia. Such peasant nobles, really..~
@843  = ~Tell me child, what brings you here to the Water Gardens? Should you not be handing out alms to the poor in the slums instead?~
@844  = ~A quaint notion that has brought your house to the brink of ruin. And please, stop this 'Lord Roenal' business. I'll not have such formalities. 'Farthington' is my name among friends.~
@845  = ~For I swear that I will own the de'Arnise lands one day and that you shall make a fine wife for my son to put upon his mantle. I'm sure you will consider me a friend then.~
@846  = ~What is it, Lady de'Arnise? Can you not see that trying to enjoy the splendors of the Water gardens?~
@847  = ~Be off with you! Go to the slums.. I'm sure there are some poor people there that could use your help.~
@848  = ~Well if it is not, Valygar Corthala..~
@849  = ~Come out from your fabulous wooden cabin in the hills to grace us with your presence?~
@850  = ~I would much rather hear squirrels rustling in the trees than be here in the city and listen to the words of a snake like you, Farthington!~
@851  = ~Blasted serfs! They really need to keep a better watch on who they let into the Water Gardens.~
@852  = ~Well, since you are here why don't you make yourself useful and fetch me a drink, will you?~
@853  = ~Have you ever thought that all people deserve to be treated equal, no matter your station in life?~
@854  = ~Yes sir! Do you take sugar in your tea?~
@855  = ~Do I look like a servant to you?~
@856  = ~Get your own bloody drinks!~
@857  = ~Just make yourself useful and leave my sight.~
@858  = ~I saw both Elminster and Volo and Lady Goldsword's dinner party the other evening.. not that a peasant like you would care about such things.~
@859  = ~*sigh* I cannot belive that Lady Goldsword is allowing that penniless painter, Paris, to stay in her home! He is nothing more than a thief!~
@860  = ~He still owes my son, Quint, some portraits that we paid him for. That lazy gutter urchin will probably take forever getting them done!~
@861  = ~I wonder if Fulbert has time speak to me today about those documents I need. Knowing him however, he is probably spending all his time marketing in the Gem District.~
@862  = ~That is fine.. I shall find him at Lady Goldsword's dinner party tonight if need be. I also must speak to him about these disturbing rumors I have been hearing about his niece Lady Héloïse and her teacher, Lord Abelard.~
@863  = ~No doubt those quibbling nobles from Trademeet, the Lurraxols and the Alibakkars will be there. Ugh! What a headache it is to hear them argue over whose ancestor who founded the city.~
@864  = ~I mean really, who cares? It is only the Trademeet anyhow.. I would rather be locked in a room and forced to listen to that idiot Neeber than hear them go at it again!~
@865  = ~That Lord Donderberg is a fool if he thinks he is going to get a single platinum coin out of me for that idea of his to open a trading guild in Eshpurta.~
@866  = ~I just do not like the idea of doing business that close to the Troll Mountains. However, I must speak to Pehllus Tanislove about purchasing those lands East of Keczulla. I hear that people are making a fortune with all the gem mining there.~
@867  = ~*hmph* Begone, peasant, I have no money to give you! I am the lord of one of Amn's great families and I've no interest in talking to you, <SIRMAAM>. I'm only here to do some shopping, that's all.~
@868  = ~Oooh! I wonder if the Caravan Merchant still has the Relic of the Gnome? That thing would look great, dusted and placed upon my mantle!~
@869  = ~Yes, I believe that I met a Lord Jierdan Firkraag, who was looking for an adventurer that went by the name of <CHARNAME>. That would not be you, would it?~
@870  = ~I have already spoken to Lord Firkraag.~
@871  = ~What did this Lord Firkraag want?~
@872  = ~My name is not important.~
@873  = ~Yes, I am <PRO_HESHE>.~
@874  = ~Funny, I had never heard of him and I am familiar with all the nobility of the area. He did say he was from the Windspear Hills though.~
@875  = ~Such a rural area.. Those mountain nobles are barely better than peasants themselves if you ask me.~
@876  = ~Oh, how I enjoy a stroll in the Water Gardens on a nice day such as this. You don't have all the commotion that you get in the Promenade and it does not smell like animal feces.~
@877  = ~Which reminds me, when are they ever going to get rid of that circus? The colors are terribly garish and an eyesore and what's more, I hear they are having some kind of trouble with the staff turning people into strange creatures. The sooner the Council votes to take that thing away, the better.~
@878  = ~What we really need in this city is a coliseum and a hippodrome. Now that would be something. I mean we have all these criminals in the Slums and Docks anyhow.. Why not toss them into the arena and have them kill themselves?~
@879  = ~Of course their was a plan to build a coliseum not too long ago near the university, which I thought would have been a brilliant location. However, the funding needed fell through when Duke Eldak Glimmerson was killed in the bloody vampire wars take have terrorized the city as of late.~
@880  = ~They could still build a hippodrome though. We have some fine horses on my land and am sure that their is a champion among them. Not that you would know anything about that. Ha! I bet that you tread the way to Trademeet by foot.~
@881  = ~I'm having a difficulty with the workers at one of our gold mines. It seems those greedy bastards actually want to be fed while they work!~
@882  = ~You know what the problem with these wretched serfs is that once you feed them and they finally learn their trade, they die of plague or some other disease.~
@883  = ~It is harder to find good human servants these days and I am almost ashamed to admit it, but I find gnomish servants to be so much more agreeable.. and at a better price these days.~
@884  = ~Begging your pardon Lord Farthington, I mistook you for an apple peddler.~
@885  = ~Do forgive me, I must be on my way.~
@886  = ~I'll have you know, Lord Farthington, that some of us would like to use the privileges that we nobles have, to help other people.~
@887  = ~Don't count your chickens before they are hatched, Lord Farthington.~
@888  = ~My master, Lady Jwennilyn Goldsword, has me running all over the city to get supplies for her dinner party tonight.~
@889  = ~Luckily the cobblestone roads make travel around here in the Southern parts of the city very easy.~
@890  = ~The road behind me leads to the Eastern side of Waukeen's Promenade. The City Gates can be reached using the road that leads East, and the Bridge District can be reached by squeezing through Goldsword Villa and the shop.~
@891  = ~You can even reach the Graveyard if you go down through the Gardens and follow the path to the east.~
@892  = ~Yes, how can I be of service? Do you need directions?~
@893  = ~Yes, please tell where all all these cobble stone boulevards lead to.~
@894  = ~What is it that you do here in the Water Gardens?~
@895  = ~Do you know anything about a wizard named Irenicus?~
@896  = ~Tell me what you know about the Shadow Thieves.~
@897  = ~Tell me what you know about the Cowled Wizards.~
@898  = ~Do you know of a way to get to Spellhold?~
@899  = ~I am but a humble servant of the Lady Jwennilyn Goldsword, collecting goods at the market for the dinner party tonight and other errands. Already today, I have visited the carpenter, silver-smiths, shoemakers, soap-makers and the bakers about different things.*sigh* And I still have many things gather before tonight.~
@900  = ~I still have to get, cucumbers, pumpkins, rosemary, carrots, garlic, water mint, apples, pears, grapes, wine, cider and beer! If I did not know my way around the cobble stone boulevards, I don't think I could do it all!~
@901  = ~Ohh.. I don't know too much about such things my <LADYLORD>, I am but an ignorant peasant.~
@902  = ~Spellhold? Well, I would imagine that you would have to use magic until the city wizards stopped you. I guess that would do it.~
@903  = ~I meant a way of getting to the island.~
@904  = ~I guess that would be one way.~
@905  = ~You mean Irenicus, or "Jon the Shattered One". The name is born out of hatred, self-pity, and desire for revenge. Legend has it that Irenicus was already a powerful spellcaster, but sought the power of the gods themselves, and tried to enter the elven pantheon.~
@906  = ~But what would an ignorant servant like me know about such things, huh?~
@907  = ~Well, excuse me, but you should have said that. How am I supposed to know what you mean unless you express yourself clearly?~
@908  = ~Getting to the island should be easy. Can't you get a ride from a merchant ship? With enough gold, anything is possible.~
@909  = ~I you can think of a better way, then speak up. Not that I care.. If you want to get yourself locked up for all eternity, be my guest.~
@910  = ~Word has it that those wizards steal the joy of your soul while you rot away in a magically induced state. None that have ever been imprisoned inside have ever made it out alive though, so who knows what is true, and what isn't.~
@911  = ~All I know is that the baker near the Gem District is having a special today and I have to ride a camel there and back, picking up four jugs of wine on the way. The dinner party tonight is going to be one to remember.. but then again, they all are...~
@912  = ~Well it was nice to make your acquaintance, even if only for a fleeting moment in the sands of time. That you, the Hero of the Sword Coast would waste the time to speak to an ignorant peasant like me is astonishing.~
@913  = ~Maybe one day I will see you while walking across the Water Gardens. If that happens, do not be afraid to say hello.~
@914  = ~Although being a servant to Lady Matilda is not the most luxurious job, I'm glad that I no longer have to live in the Slums.~
@915  = ~What can you tell me about Lady Matilda?~
@916  = ~The Slums are not so bad.~
@917  = ~She is a nice lady.. not too needy. Keeps my family fed and out of the slums.~
@918  = ~A bit of a cougar though, she prefers the company of virile adventurers to stuffy noblemen. Aside from myself, who only handles her daily marketing for her, all her other servants at here estate are large, well-muscled men, whose bodies glisten from the body she personally puts on them. Too bad I'm only there during the day. Who knows what goes on there at night.~
@919  = ~And she has dozens of them. Not that she cannot afford it. She is extremely wealthy after inheriting diamond mines from Kezculla her grandfather, Lord Leopold Colwyvvs.~
@920  = ~You know, the slums are not so bad.~
@921  = ~Ha! Says you.. An adventurer with magical weapons at your disposal and a fortune of platinum in your coin purse, but try raising an honest family there on a few copper coins a week.~
@922  = ~The place is infested with cockroaches. You can't keep food around the house without them crawling all over it and every night you can feel them crawling swarming betwixt the bed sheets..~
@923  = ~Then there is the human kind of cockroaches, which are much worse. Killers, thieves and slavers. The slums are packed with them. Don't go outside at night by yourself, they would say, or you might find yourself locked up in some slaver's pen.~
@924  = ~And believe me, I never would venture out at night. Far too dangerous!~
@925  = ~Rumor has it that Lord Abelard is secretly in a scandalous affair with his student, Lady Héloïse.~
@926  = ~I fear what her Uncle Fulbert would do if the rumors were true.~
@927  = ~I think I will have a refreshing drink at the Blue Unicorn after I am done with my marketing.~
@928  = ~Hopefully Deekin Scalesinger is playing there tonight. I find his music to be so soothing.~
@929  = ~Maybe afterwards I will play some billiards at the Red Lion Restaurant after that.~
@930  = ~Hmph.  Begone!  I have many duties to perform and no time to waste on one such as you!~
@931  = ~I don't like the looks of this!~
@932  = ~ Go for the eyes Boo, GO FOR THE EYES!!  RrraaaAAGHGHH!!!~ [MINSC10]
@933  = ~Ummm.. not at the moment, M'lady.~
@934  = ~Inspiration is not the word.~
@935  = ~ I do not care o'ermuch for being prodded all the time.~ [HAERDA27]
@936  = ~ Best to make a swift escape now, my raven!~ [HAERDA03]
@937  = ~What is it that you ask?~ [CERND23]
@938  = ~Gods of nature, protect me!~ [CERND03]
@939  = ~Definitely a turnip.~ [JANJAN02]
@940  = ~I know exactly what you mean! We need salt though.. LOTS of salt!~ [JANJAN04]
@941  = ~Let me run down to the docks and get some... the docks of Calimshan!~
@942  = ~(Dear lord, why must I always suffer the indignity of these morons?)~
@943  = ~Go bother someone else.~ [EDWIN23]
@944  = ~I could use some help here, fools.~ [EDWIN15]
@945  = ~If memory serves... What does it matter?~ [YOSHIM25]
@946  = ~ Time for a quick exit, I would say...~ [YOSHIM02]
@947  = ~Excuse me, m'lady, but that kind of talk is hardly fitting for a noblewoman.~ [KELDOR30]
@948  = ~M'lady!! Please, behave yourself!~ [KELDOR32]
@949  = ~I beg your pardon Lady Tandolan, but I shall go wherever I see fit.~
@950  = ~The Delryn whelp?!  You've no business, here, Anomen Delryn! Take your friends and leave the Water Gardens at once!~
@951  = ~What cheek! How dare a disgusting ruffian like yourself make advances on a noblewoman! Oo!! What do you vermin wish now? The guard will hear of this outrage! Far too many beggars about, these days. Raise the taxes and force them to work, I say!~
@952  = ~Away from me, peasant! This place is not for common gutterskunks like you!~
@953  = ~Why must this plaza always be crowded with brainless debutantes? Have you met Aliella Sapphiredge?~
@954  = ~Still, it is a mild discomfort compared to the chaos of the Center District. Do you not find the crowds about Waukeen's Promenade quite simply overwhelming this time of year?~
@955  = ~So I said to the Baron, 'Honestly, sir! You must learn to control yourself!"~
@956  = ~Do you have reason for intruding on my private thoughts? I should like to hear it. Begone with you, rabble! There are enough problems in this city without you ruffians adding to things, do you not agree? On with your business. Don't bother me.~
@957  = ~You are involved in that business with Lady Lilith and Lord Skarmaen, aren't you? Ha! Those families would destroy this town just to prove who is more respected!~
@958  = ~Hmm..  It would be troubling to choose between the Lurraxols and the Alibakkars. The Lord Skarmaen does seem wealthier, but Lady Lilith has that certain charm that makes people want to be around her.~
@959  = ~What started the feud between the two families?~
@960  = ~How did Lord Skarmaen make his fortune?~
@961  = ~By charm, do you mean, large breasts?~
@962  = ~I believe it has to do with the Mantle of Waukeen and whose family were the true founders of the Trademeet, although I could be mistaken.~
@963  = ~All I know for certain is that the two families have been at each others throat's for generations. Lady Lilith's nephew, Lysan Lurraxol was knifed in the chest by some Alibakkar thugs when visiting the Umar Hills last summer. Luckily for him, he was wearing a breastplate of enchanted armor under his tunic or he would have been slain for certain.~
@964  = ~At least they manage to keep things civil here in the Water Gardens. The guards have zero tolerance for any violent outburts here, so not even the power that the Lurraxols and Alibakkars command will make them turn a blind eye to a disturbance.~
@965  = ~She is blessed in that aspect, although some say that she wears a necklace that magically enhances their size.~
@966  = ~What I was really refering to, was her commanding presence in a room. Everyone is drawn to her, not only by her beauty, but also because of the veracity of her words.~
@967  = ~Well, being from the Trademeet, I would have thought that the obvious answer would be trade.~
@968  = ~Gems, spices, sugar, horses, mules, dried fruits, iron weapon, magical items... Lord Skarmaen has his fingers in almost everything that passes through Trademeet.~
@969  = ~His Uncle Erlranther Alibakkar is the current Meisarch of the Council of Six, and conveniently overlooks any tariffs on goods that are imported or exported by his nephew, making Lord Skarmaen even wealthier.~
@970  = ~I bought a most wonderful necklace off a man in the street! For diamonds, it was a fabulous bargain!~
@971  = ~Hmmmn... Who in the blazes are you?~
@972  = ~Small nose, rancid smell... hmm... must be gibberling!~
@973  = ~Or a serf!~
@974  = ~Do you really think I would associate with such a base commoner such as yourself? I am a woman of refinement and taste, good <MANWOMAN>. Away with you...I doubt we have any business, the two of us.~
@975  = ~Excuse me, <SIRMAAM>, but you do know this is a private area of the city, correct? I am surprised you were allowed to come within these walls. You will find yourself unwelcome here.~
@976  = ~At any rate, I think it is time that you are leaving.  A good day and good business to you, my <LADYLORD>. And make sure you place your garbage where it belongs while you are here. This is Athkatla, not some barbarian village!~
@977  = ~I am not certain, but I think this is the man that sold Boo to Minsc. The pointy hat looks very familiar.~ [MINSC03]

// NEW (v.13.5)
@978 = ~I have a slightly odd request. Could you prepare a cure for... uh, a monkey? The local animal dealer, Borivyk, has a monkey that has fallen ill.~
@979 = ~This request is really strange, but the gods on whose behalf I speak, do not refuse to help any living beings. What are the symptoms of the illness?~
@980 = ~The monkey refuses to eat and looks very weak and lethargic. Also he coughs more often than he should, we noticed.~
@981 = ~Well, I think I get the point. This is a typical illness for such animals when they live in captivity away from their usual living conditions.~
@982 = ~Now I will prepare the medicine which is to be given to this monkey in the morning and evening. If everything is done correctly, he will recover soon.~
@983 = ~Now go my friend, I have other services that I need attending to.~
