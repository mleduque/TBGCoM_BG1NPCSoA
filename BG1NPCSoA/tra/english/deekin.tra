@154 = ~Sir Paladin isn't going to smite Deekin for being a kobold?~
@155 = ~Deekin I have traveled far and wide enough in my time that I have come to learn I am not to judge a book by its cover. There are times when evil hides it's ill intent with a tractable facade, where as the just can be found in the strangest of places.~
@156 = ~Okay, speaking about books maybe Deekin could write your autobiography? It sounds to Deekin that Sir Paladin has a lot of stories to tell, not as many as the boss but still.~
@157 = ~My life is one of service and honor, I doubt it would make for a good reading.~
@158 = ~Sir Paladin is wrong, everyone life is great tale. It just need to be spun.~
@159 = ~Well Deekin maybe we can talk about the past later as I prefer to live in the present rather than get lost in the miasma of the past.~

@161 = ~Ah my minute friend, as the pleasant breeze brushes your face now, may later become a hurricane that can up root the mightiest of oaks. Nature has many faces and as one of her followers, so do I.~
@162 = ~Okay, I was wondering if you could show Deekin how turn into a big dragon.~

@166 = ~Deekin is hoping to get his next book translated into Undercommon.~
@167 = ~I dread the answer to this question, but why?~
@168 = ~Deekin's next work will be a book to help Kobolds who have escaped to the surface like where to get food and how to say please don't squish me. Deekin thinks his work could help others escape from the Underdark.~
@169 = ~While I question your methods it is however not the most foolish thing you have said, perhaps there is some merit in the idea . I am sure those naked fools of Elistree would find a use for it, even if it is just used to cover their modesty.~
@170 = ~Doom Doom, er, *cough* *cough* err, Deekin thinks he as a frog in his throat.~
@171 = ~I doubt you have a frog or any other amphibians in your throat. What you have is strained your voice with all your singing. Your voice is like any of your instruments, it can be damaged if over used.~
@172 = ~Okay. *cough* *cough*~
@173 = ~By the horns of Silvanus, try this tincture. The herbs in it will help with the pain. Its the same mixture I gave Garrick when he came back after cavorting all night in Baldur's Gate and couldn't sing a note.~
@174 = ~Tastes fishy with hint of juniper berries or dragonfruit... Hey Deekin's voice feel better, thank you, Jaheira.~
@175 = ~It was an easy task. Now keep quiet or you'll risk straining your voice again and I for one do not wish to go through this again.~
@176 = ~So my miniature dragon, I hear you traveled to the far frozen north, you must have a tale to spin about it no?~
@177 = ~Deekin didn't like it much, its so cold his scales went blue and his tail nearly dropped. The only stories they wanted to hear was about Drizzt doing this or Drizzt doing that, No time for much else.~
@178 = ~Ah, hero worship is a dangerous thing in the north. In my homeland the Kensai gain all the glory but also they attract the most enemies. Fame be a fickle mistress, one wrong word and her wrath will be greater than the breath of any Dragon.~
@179 = ~I must say Deekin it has been a long time since I have tasted such a fine meal, you clearly have a knack for halfling cooking Deekin.~
@180 = ~Oh thank you, thank you! Deekin is so happy, Deekin traveled with a Halfling caravan in his early adventures with his old boss.~
@181 = ~What is it Deekin? You don't seem yourself all of a sudden.~
@182 = ~Deekin wonders sometimes what happened to old friends and boss.~
@183 = ~Aye the loss of comrades is a painful thing but we honor them with our deeds and carry them with us always.~
@184 = ~Errr... Mazzy...~
@185 = ~What is it, Deekin?~
@186 = ~Thank you.~
@187 = ~Oh, Deekin, hi down their bud, didn't see you there. My mind has being a hot fiery mess, you know with all the stuff with the enclave and Imoen and I was feeling a bit bummed out. Then I had a thought "Hey Neera, you could ask Deekin to sing a song to cheer you up" err you do know a song like that right?~
@188 = ~Deekin sang this song for his last boss once I think it made him laugh *coughs*.~
@189 = ~There once be a red wizard of Thay,
Who never had time to play!
His patience eroded
Until his head exploded,
And the stain on the wall never quite went away!~
@190 = ~An exploding Red Wizards song can't be beat! That was the best thing I have heard all week ,thanks bud that made my day.~
@191 = ~Deekin, you're a bard and playwright, so can you tell me why there is no plays about the tragic lives of the needy and the poor?~
@192 = ~Deekin thinks miss Nalia might not like the answer. Rich humans tend to find the lives of dem selfs and others errr a bit dull and they needs to find a way to make them less dull so plays tend to do that and that what writers write.~
@193 = ~So they would rather fritter their time living a dream, rather than trying to understand their fellows?~
@194 = ~Maybes miss Nalia could patronize Deekin to write her stories. Deekin's reputation as great hero will make sure that at least some people might read 'em.~
@195 = ~I am sorry, Deekin, but I think the money could be put to better use to solve actual problems rather than write about them.~
@196 = ~Deekin, did I ever tell you about the time my third cousin twice removed, Fimbar Jansen, infiltrated a kobold lair?~
@197 = ~Deekin knows this will involve turnips.~
@198 = ~Oh, is that so? Deekin you don't know that until you've heard it and as a bard I bet you're itching to hear.~
@199 = ~Errr... Somethin's itching...~
@200 = ~Well, cousin Fimbar was the first mercenary on his side of the family, his Ma was so proud, since the price of turnip chutney had sank to all new low. Fimbar had to take a job to secure a great treasure from the kobold mines of Kulbeckna so he could get the gold to put the turnips on the table. Fimbar braved the coldest mountains, the blazing deserts and stormy seas to gain entrance to the great mines of Kulbeckna. he strode into the great halls armed only with his family's salad server, ready to smite the hoards of kobolds that would come screaming with a blood curdling roar. Well as it turned out the mine was empty and the kobolds moved on to staff Firescales the Fiery and his dungeon of freshly fried fiends. By the time Fimbar got home the chutney market was saved from certain doom, due to the fact his Turnip chutney also made great glue to hold shelves up and Fimbar never had to leave the house again.~
@201 = ~Umm is okay, but Deekin not remember how to spell Chutney, so maybe Deekin focus on the boss first.~
@202 = ~Deekin was wondering how much orc-face get paid by his patron.~
@203 = ~It's not that kind of patron cur. You test my patience with your endless drivel, I would do this group a favor by skinning your hide and using it as a belt.~
@204 = ~Deekin not... errr... Feeling to good, his, errr... Scalerott is playing up again... So Deekin just gonna hides behinds the boss.~
@205 = ~Deekin, I would like to be regaled with stories of brave knights and fair maidens. You can do that, right kobold? Or are you here just to be decorative?~
@206 = ~Deekin's old Master used to love tales of knights and princesses too... Mostly being eaten by dragons, he would laugh so much he would fall off his favorite rock.~
@207 = ~Forget I asked, I dread to hear the nonsense you peddle, for its not doubt fit only for the lowest whorehouse.~
@208 = ~You sound a lot like old master, he made smelly noises in his sleep too.~
@209 = ~Errr... Boss? Deekin sees dead people.~
@210 = ~Yes you do and I see a kobold your point?~
@211 = ~Deekin wonders he spends more time being dead then not dead, Deekin most be doing something wrong.~
@212 = ~You need to learn to survive on your own Deekin. Hero worshiping will never let you step out of your Boss' Shadow.~
@213 = ~Boss is nice to Deekin, better than the old master.~
@214 = ~So you exchanged bondage for servitude? I pity you little one.~
@215 = ~Deekin hasn't seen a face so grumpy since his old master fell asleep on all the pointy bits of his hoard.~
@216 = ~Does this conversation have any point? If not I suggest you focus on the problems in front of us bard.~
@217 = ~Deekin just worried Valygar never smiles, he seems more edgy and broody than stories bard sing about Drizzt.~
@218 = ~After meeting, I begin to wonder how stories like his get twisted for the entertainment of the masses. Where does fact end and fiction begin?~
@219 = ~Errr... Deekin thinks its what the reader takes from the story rather than if its true or not.~
@220 = ~You sure are a cheerful one aren't you Deekin? Just being with you makes things seem a little less hopeless at least.~
@221 = ~Miss Imoen, you're the Boss' sister aren't you?~
@222 = ~Yep sure am, although its odd to say it out load but I think I kinda always knew, so whats up little fella?~
@223 = ~Deekin was wondering if you knew any stories of the boss during their younger days? Maybe <PRO_HESHE> got sat on by dragon or opened a portal to the plane of water and flooded the Library at Candlekeep?~
@224 = ~Well nothing like that but I'm sure a little embellishment wouldn't hurt.~
@225 = ~Deekin, the little kobold bard, who has been beside you, since you met him in the Water Gardens district frantically scribbles down details of the eleven palace in front of him.~
@226 = ~Deekin? Ready for the final act?~
@227 = ~Deekins with you boss alls the way, Huzzah.~
@228 = ~Deekin, Irenicus is a powerful mage, you don't need to be here, you could leave and go back to writing your books.~
@229 = ~If Deekin missed the final chapter of the Boss' quest Deekin would be doing a disservice to his loyal fan base.~
@230 = ~Get you scaly arse down those steps now!~
@231 = ~Errr... No need to yell boss, Deekin can see creepy staircase, who hides a staircase behind a waterfall anyways? Make floors all slippy, Deekin could break his neck!~
@232 = ~Ohhh, Deekin dead again? Deekin thinks he spends more time dead then not dead! Boss, this Hell, Deekin been here before but it was a lot colder, errr... shalls we move on?~

@240 = ~Miss Aerie, they vanished back home after we lifted the curse on their town.~
@241 = ~Back home... they are still out there then, I... don't think I couldn't go back there, not like this with these scars not without my wings, no I can't... not any more.~
@242 = ~Deekin, if you have a question please ask it rather then starring at me, it is unsettling and I do not want my meditations being disrupted, so speak now.~
@243 = ~Deekin was wondering what the meaning behind your tattoos? There's lots of them and you don't hide them like some other humans with the names of their ex lovers on their arms or nether bits.~
@244 = ~No nothing as crass as that. They are like scars, each is a memory engraved on my skin and on my soul. They remind me me each day how I failed my brother and Selune.~
@245 = ~With the Boss travelling with a bear and kobold, Deekin is surprised that the Cowled ones haven't thrown us in Spellhold yet.~
@246 = ~Snuffle growl snuffle!~
@247 = ~Heh, Deekin thought that was good pun, but Wilson not think so. I guess we will say it just good plan then okay?~
@248 = ~Growl!~
@249 = ~Its a good plan, okay.~

@250 = ~Do you... have a kobold travelling with you?~
@251 = ~Deekin is a kobold, yes, and Deekin is a bard. ~
@252 = ~A... Kobold Bard? What's next? Kobold Paladin?~
@253 = ~Deekin would like to be a kobold paladin but also be a bard. Deekin thinks that would be very difficult life path though.~
@254 = ~By the gods! And here I thought I've seen everything, apparently not!~
@255 = ~Is that a kobold? Why hasn't it been killed yet?~
@256 = ~Deekin is a good kobold, and Deekin is also a bard. Deekin sang even for dragon in High Forest, so the dragon did not eat Deekin. Now Deekin sings for adventurers, so they don't kill Deekin.~
@257 = ~It stinks of kobolds here! Who is that behind you in the back, a kobold?~
@258 = ~Deekin is indeed a kobold, and Deekin is also a bard. Deekin tries not to smell like kobolds, but so far he's not very good at it. Deekin will try harder.~
@259 = ~Deekin knows the song about the good drow, Drrr.. Dzzz... Err, Deekin has a hard time saying the name of the good drow, but Deekin can sing the song and the drow mom will be kind too.~
@260 = ~What the...? Am I hearing Drizzt's name coming from this kobold's slave mouth?! I will cut out your filthy tongue and leave you to an Aboleth. How dare you have the audacity to speak to me in such a way you wretched creature!~
@261 = ~*Hides behind <CHARNAME>*. Deekin is very sorry, Deekin will no longer mention the complicated name. Deekin didn't mean to anger the drow mom. ~
@262 = ~Maybe Deekin will sing for the evil wizard? Deekin knows many songs about good wizards, Deekin will sing them, and the evil wizard will become kind yes?~
@263 = ~*Ignores Deekin*~
@264 = ~What? What?! Kobolds singing to dragons? This world must be mad! Well if you insist on living, please do your utmost not to make a mess as your transverse through here if you would please. *Sigh*.~
@265 = ~Hmfph! Just great: kobolds running amuck smelling up the place. At least this one has some sort of decency to acknowledge it's putrid existence. So if you would please, hurry about your business here and leave as soon as possible. We don't need it to smell like a peasant's bath house around here!~
@266 = ~You propose musical antics will sway my heart piteous jester? My heart has been cursed, cursed beyond your comprehensible touch. It is not possible to sway my heart for the acts of justice and kindness that you wish to contaminate me with. I have been left to rot and forever forgotten, and while I become reminiscent of why this has happened to me, you have only fueled my anger of those who have cursed me and now I desire my revenge all the more for it!~
@267 = ~Do we have to fight? Maybe Deekin can change your mind, evil wizard?~

// NEW (v.13.3)
@268 = ~Maybe Deekin will sing for the dragon and the dragon won't eat Deekin and <CHARNAME>?~
@269 = ~Interesting companions you usher with you, Bhaal child. Listen here small one; I don't consume kobolds, much less listen to their melodies. Now remove yourself from my sight worthless creature.~
@270 = ~Deekin will try his best to walk away and stop being a worthless creature. Deekin promises.~
@271 = ~Deekin can play for the pale lady, sing a song about kind... er... Deekin apologizes, but he doesn't know songs about kind vampires.~
@272 = ~Oh? Is it now fashionable to go everywhere with a kobold these days? Or does this one have some magical skills that are actually beneficial? Begone with you kobold, I have no interest in your nonsense.~
@273 = ~Maybe Deekin will sing for the sad dragon? Deekin had already sung for the bored and unkind dragon, and Deekin could make the dragon happy.~
@274 = ~I thank you little creature for your attempt to raise morale. But at this time, jingles and theatrics can hardly help me now.~
@275 = ~Deekin sees how bored the big dragon is. Maybe Deekin will play and sing to make the dragon happier?~
@276 = ~A kobold here in the Watcher's Keep who wishes to cheer me up with his melodies? This must be the start of madness... very well small one, boredom does overwhelm me at the moment, so play me a tune kobold and maybe I'll let you live. In fact I might even leave *you* with me as payment for the trouble you caused me.~
@277 = ~*Starts to play and then stops* Deekin is very sorry, but Deekin is unwell, Deekin promises to play another time.~
@278 = ~*Sniffs at Deekin* There's something about this little creature, something... I can't figure it out, perhaps I will let him live for now until I can contemplate a conclusion.~
@279 = ~*The dragon either growls or snorts* Centuries of imprisonment in this accursed tower can take its toll on even an ancient dragon. Well, adventurers, whether you try to retrieve this mighty sword or I go to sleep, either option is fine for me at the moment.~
