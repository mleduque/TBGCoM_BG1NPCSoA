@262  = ~If you keep speaking to me like that, I will rip out your tongue.~
@263  = ~By Shar! Why must I suffer the pointless rambling of this stupid gnome?~
@264  = ~Repent your evil ways, drow, and follow the evil ways of Tiax the Great.~
@265  = ~Only then will you become cleansed enough to become my pleasure slave!~
@266  = ~Do you ever shut up?~
@267  = ~*sigh* It is times like this that I wonder why I ever left the Underdark?~
@268  = ~Being tossed in the drider web pits could not have been much worse than having to listen to you all day!~
@269  = ~REPENT!!!!!!~ [tiaxm]
@270  = ~Do you ever stop whining, Avariel?~
@271  = ~UGH! If I have to listen to you tell the rest of us how sad you are and how rotten things are down here, one more time, I will shoot myself in the face with a magic missle!!!~ [tiaxm]
@272  = ~This...this isn't as wonderful as I thought it would be, traveling with you.~ [AERIE04]
@273  = ~I thought all gnomes were like Uncle Quayle, but you are so grumpy all the time.~ [AERIE22]
@274  = ~Being around you is enough to make anyone grumpy!~
@275  = ~Traveling with you has not been exactly peachy either.. All you ever do is talk about yourself and how you are going to rule the world.. It's rather tiresome!~
@276  = ~Woman! You are insane! Tiax the great is the best traveling companion that any adventurer could ever hope to meet!~
@277  = ~It is just no use talking to you.~
@278  = ~TIAX WILL RULE!!!~ [tiax3]
@279  = ~Once Tiax the Gnomequeror rules all, he will build a castle that will make de'Arnise Keep look like an adobe of peasants!~ [tiax3]
@280  = ~You will have us over every now and then for tea, won't you?~ [NALIA31]
@281  = ~Silence! When Tiax rules, you will be nothing more than a servant!~
@282  = ~So.. no tea huh?~ [NALIA32]
@283  = ~How dare you mock Tiax the Mighty!~
@284  = ~*rolls eyes* Well that takes little daring.~ [NALIA33]
@285  = ~Tell me, do you have any ideas for social reform once Tiax rules all?~
@286  = ~All others shall be as ants, serving the will of Tiax the Courageous!~
@287  = ~Does that make you the queen of the anthill?~ [NALIA29]
@288  = ~YES! Tiax will be the most powerful queen... er.. I mean king, yes, KING, most powerful king, EVER!!!~
@289  = ~*snicker*~ [NALIA28]
@290  = ~What good can traveling with a miserable Kara-Turan thief like this one here do? Tiax the Wise does not understand the reasoning behind it.~
@291  = ~Would you understand it any less it I took my katana and sliced off your head?~ [YOSHIM04]
@292  = ~Bah! Tiax the Revenger is able to summon undead warriors to do his dirty work for him. I moments you would be swarmed by fleash eating ghasts! Watching them kill you would bring Tiax much pleasure!~ [tiax3]
@293  = ~I still have no met the conjurer that can cast a spell faster than I can draw my katana.~ [YOSHIM10]
@294  = ~Foolish thief! When Tiax rules all, the only use that skill will have for you is for picking vegetables faster!~
@295  = ~Be silent, gnome, or I shall silence you.~ [YOSHIM05]
@296  = ~Inactive outward, inactive inward. (Why do I suffer these fools?)~
@297  = ~Tiax, why don't you tell us how you are going to rule all one day. That is always good for a laugh when I am bored.~
@298  = ~Tiax is not here to amuse you, red wizard! Tiax the Gnomequeror is here to learn all the skills he will need once he becomes master of all that he surveys.~
@299  = ~Yes, that is the stuff! Very amusing.~
@300  = ~Are you deaf, you cup shot mutton head? Tiax will not be mocked by a mere worker bee like you! Tiax will slap ya silly when he rules.~ [tiax$]
@301  = ~Your words please, though I know not their motive...~
@302  = ~Tell me, elf, do you think that your feeble Harpers will even put up a fight once Tiax rules all and an entire legion of his berserker orcs are swarming down on them?~
@303  = ~A demented gnome like you will never even rule a garbage heap much less all of Faerûn.~ [JAHEIR04]
@304  = ~Do you have problems listening, with those big, pointy ears of yours?~
@305  = ~It is DESTINY, that Tiax the Gnomequeror rule all because Cyric has declared it so!~ [TIAX2]
@306  = ~If you think it wise to act in this manner, I will leave you and say no more. Remember though  that in life, so much comes back to haunt us.~ [JAHEIR35]
@307  = ~Tell me Tiax, once you rule all, what are you planning on doing about the outbreak of the plague that begins anytime the social order breaks down and things are left on the streets, rotting? The people would need care and medicine.~ [NALIA32]
@308  = ~Bah! Tiax would have those disease ridden vermin tossed into an oven and throw their ashes into the sea for he refuses to spend his gold on loafers.~
@309  = ~Well then, who is going to do all the farming? Do you think that it is magic that brings fresh fruits and vegetables to the market?~ [NALIA35]
@310  = ~It will.. when Tiax rules!!~
@311  = ~And if you burn all the poor, who is going to build all your golden castles?~ [NALIA38]
@312  = ~Magic..~
@313  = ~And who is going to protect your castles from marauders?~ [NALIA04]
@314  = ~The answer is always MAGIC!~
@315  = ~Figures..~ [NALIA31]
@316  = ~Speak barbarian! Where did you acquire that Miniature Giant Space Hamster of yours? Tiax the Gnomequeror demands to know!~
@317  = ~If you must know, he was given to me by a funny wizard that wore a pointy hat named, Elminster.~
@318  = ~What? You mean to tell me that the legendary Sage of Shadowdale, Elminster Aumar, sold you that rodent?~ [PPTIAX18]
@319  = ~Boo is no rodent!~
@320  = ~No, of course he is not... How many gold coins would it take for me to buy it from you?~
@321  = ~Boo is not for sale, little gnome.~
@322  = ~Bah! You fool! When Tiax rules all, anything and everything shall be his possesions! You are only holding it until my eventual rise.~
@323  = ~Calm down, little gnome, or I'm afraid Boo might bite you once more.~
@324  = ~Tiax will rule all!~ [TIAXt]
@325  = ~Tell me you miserable thief, what good will come from all your stealing when Tiax the Destroyer rules all?~
@326  = ~His legions will break down your door with thier axes and take your loot as the spoils of war! None shall be spared!~
@327  = ~You believe this because Cyric told you so, in a dream? Where you eating those blue caps before you went to sleep that night I wonder?~ [YOSHIM09]
@328  = ~It is destiny, thief! DESTINY! Just like it is your destiny to die locked up in a dungeon.~ [TIAX2]
@329  = ~I'll take my chances.~ [YOSHIM27]
@330  = ~Not when Tiax rules, you will not! When Tiax rules, all thieves shall have their hands chopped off for their crimes.~
@331  = ~This gnome grows more deluded by the second.~ [YOSHIM32]
@332  = ~When Tiax rules, you shall invent him a contraption that will calculate and collect the taxes the serfs owe him.~ [TIAXa]
@333  = ~Bah, I already told you that would not work for you even for all the turnips in the world!~
@334  = ~You damn turnip eating fool! When Tiax rules, you will have no choice but to serve him.~ [PPTIAX11]
@335  = ~Tiax will rule when pigs fly!~
@336  = ~Pigs? HA! When Tiax rules, he will ride upon one of the fabled flying, white elephants of the circus in Athkatla to glory!~ [PPTIAX09]
@337  = ~Are you a good dancer, Jaheira? I hope so... For when Tiax rules, all elven women shall be made to dance for his amusement!~
@338  = ~Do you never tire of these pointless banters?~
@339  = ~Pointless? To the contrary, my dear elf.. When Tiax, rules all of you shall dance or feel the point pressed sharply against your back! Tiax shall have all that he demands! Nothing shall ever be denied him!~ [TIAXa]
@340  = ~If I ever had doubts about your sanity before, they are all gone now. Change your ways, Tiax, or we shall be at odds!~ [JAHEIR05]
@341  = ~When Tiax rules, all the nobles shall be forced to pay him taxes until Tiax has a pile of gold coins that reaches the stars!~ [TIAXa]
@342  = ~Just make sure that while you are sitting on that pile of gold, laughing to yourself, that you don't fall down and break your crown.~ [NALIA39]
@343  = ~BAH! Your words are meaningless! Only what Tiax the Wise thinks is important once he rules!~ [TIAXg]
@344  = ~You still have not told me how it is that you plan on taking over.~ [NALIA32]
@345  = ~Tiax the Destroyer does not reveal his plans to peasant nobles like you! Suffice it to say that Cyric shall provide a pathway to greatness!~
@346  = ~So in other words, you have no idea.~ [NALIA29]
@347  = ~Have you no ears? I said it was destiny! DESTINY! Cyric has decreed it and so it shall be!~ [TIAX2]
@348  = ~I'll believe it when I see it.~
@349  = ~Tell me little gnome, why do you always speak of ruling all? Would it not be better if you sought to find happiness in your life instead of trying to enslave others?~
@350  = ~Did you take a club to the head or something, barbarian? Tiax the Wise does not remember you ever speaking in such a concise manner, even if he still has no idea what you are speaking of!~ [PPTIAX18]
@351  = ~You make me laugh, little gnome. You speak about ruling all, but how many times would you have been squished like a bug were it not for my sword arm?~
@352  = ~Tiax is not a little gnome! Even though in his youth, he may have been considered a bit small by gnomish standards, Almighty Tiax will rise to heavenly heights once he rules all!~ [TIAXa]
@353  = ~Is that it, little gnome? Did the other gnomes make fun of you when you were a child? Are those hurtful memories  why you are so focused in taking over the world?~
@354  = ~Tiax the Destroyer no longer wishes to speak to you, barbarian!~
@355  = ~Boo says 'what?'~ [MINSC26]
@356  = ~Tell me thief.. have I told you that Tiax will rule all?!~ [TIAXa]
@357  = ~Only a million times or so. In fact if I hear it one more time, I think I'm going to have to use my katana to make it stop.~ [YOSHIM35]
@358  = ~You? You are but a mere ant, tugging along a leaf to your dirt hill! Tiax will soon be seated next to the gods themselves, drinking wine from a golden goblet! What will YOU matter then?!~
@359  = ~You think the Prince of Lies has saved you a seat in the heavens, do you? Poor deluded gnome.~ [YOSHIM37]
@360  = ~DESTINY! Cyric has declared it so!~ [TIAX2]
@361  = ~You are a fool to believe anything that dark god tells you, gnome.~ [YOSHIM38]
@362  = ~Bah, you know nothing of the gods, thief!~ [TIAX#]
@363  = ~So, Tiax.. where is this Cyric of yours? Should he not have ascended you into the heavens by now?~
@364  = ~When the time is right, the DESTINY of Tiax the Powerful shall fulfill itself and all non-believers like you, elf, shall be tossed into the dungeons and forgotten about.~ [TIAX2]
@365  = ~You have telling us the same story since we first traveled together back in Baldur's Gate and I have yet to see anything to lead me to believe that you due anything but a nice stay behind bars.~
@366  = ~Bars? Bars of gold, perhaps, for when tiax rules, all the gold in Faerûn shall belong to him! Keep your petty silver and bronze, Tiax the Merciful demands the best of the best, only!~
@367  = ~You know, Tiax, turnips are a healthy snack while you are on the go..~
@368  = ~Plus they help cure insanity..~
@369  = ~Tiax the Wise hates your stupid turnips!~ [PPTIAX11]
@370  = ~I can forgive the rudeness, but calling yourself wise is simply unforgivable. I'll tell you what I'm going to do.. I'm going to a strong batch of my turnip juice, that way you can drink it after you eat.~
@371  = ~Tiax the Wise like to consume his liquids befoe he partakes in his food morsels!~ [PPTIAX09]
@372  = ~Hmmm.. I think I'll make it a double.~

//NEW (v.11.2)

// Tiax - Neera 1
@373 = ~The Red Wizards still haven't got you, girl? It's because Tiax the Great is next to you, and they are afraid of me!~ [PPTIAX10]
@374 = ~Thank you, Tiax. How good it is to know that a powerful gnome like you is guarding me! ~
@375 = ~You are a smart girl to show respect for Tiax! For this he will find a place for you in his harem, and you will be honored to serve him! Soon he will rule over all of Toril - So decided Cyric!~ [TIAX3]
@376 = ~Cyric? But that is the god of lies, isn't it? He often lies and cannot be trusted.~
@377 = ~Neera, this is useless - You won't bring him to his senses. Many have already tried.~
@378 = ~Cyric would never lie to Tiax like some ordinary mortal! ~
@379 = ~But it's hard to rule the world. Imagine how many enemies you will have who will want to take your place!~
@380 = ~All enemies will tremble at the might of Tiax the Almighty! ~ [tiaxa]
@381 = ~You have an answer to everything, Tiax. It's a shame I can't do that. ~

// Tiax - Wilson
@382 = ~Sniff-Sniff... ~
@383 = ~Stop sniffing Tiax, hairy creature!~ [TIAXm]
@384 = ~Bears like you should amuse Tiax at the circus by jumping over a hoop, not walking around here!~
@385 = ~Grr-urrr... ~
@386 = ~Wilson seems to like you, Tiax! ~
@387 = ~Bah! When Tiax rules, all bears will be required to bring him wild berries for dessert every day!~ [Tiax#]

// Tiax - Neera 2
@388 = ~Tiax, who were your parents? Tell me about them. ~
@389 = ~Parents?~ [PPTIAX26]
@390 = ~Yes. After all, you once had them.~
@391 = ~... ~
@392 = ~Tiax doesn't remember much... His father ... He was a trader. Although it doesn't matter now!! Tiax saw the Black Sun and understood his purpose!~ [TIAXk]
@393 = ~Tiax will rule the world!!! ~ [tiaxa]
@394 = ~Poor thing, you don't even remember your parents... I wish I could help you. Hopefully you can still recover your sanity, but my magic might turn you into a squirrel instead. Better not to risk it.~

// Tiax - Rasaad
@395 = ~What a pity that such a sincere faith has driven you to such madness. This is what it means to succumb to temptation and believe in false gods...~
@396 = ~IN FALSE GODS? Cyric is more real than you yourself, fool! For such heresy, he will curse you! You will be doomed to stand on all fours and beg forgiveness until the end of time!~ [PPTIAX18]
@397 = ~I will pray that you get well, little gnome.~
@398 = ~BAH! What is this madness?~ [PPTIAX15]

// Tiax - Neera 3
@399 = ~Hey magician, take it! I order you to take this!~ [PPTIAX10]
@400 = ~What are these? These are... flowers? Are you giving these to me?~
@401 = ~Yes. You were kind to the great Tiax and showed due respect, but he knows how to be grateful and collected these plants for you!~
@402 = ~He heard somewhere that you women love this kind of thing.~
@403 = ~This is... so heartwarming. Thank you, Tiax. This one flower is especially beautiful, I will weave it in my hair.~
@404 = ~I think I'm going to be sick!~
@405 = ~To be honest, I'm amazed, Neera. How did you become friends with this madman? I was sure that he did not see anyone around but himself. I suppose nature keeps giving us surprises.~
@406 = ~There is good in all of us - Well, except for the Red Wizards, of course.~
@407 = ~And besides people like of Xzar and Montaron. ~
@408 = ~You're damn right, girl! Kindness is for weaklings!~
@409 = ~Sometimes goodness is hidden deep within the soul, and the one who seems good can betray at any moment. That's why I love nature more than anything else. There, the truth is immediately visible and the animals never hide their true nature.~
