@30   = ~A magic lamp? Hmmm.. just like the one my Great Uncle Cornelius used to tell me about in stories.~

@105  = ~How dare you talk to Tiax the Gnomequeror in such a manner?~ [tiax8]

@107  = ~You know we have several other attractions, like the bearded lady, fish-boy, and the insane exploding clowns.. Why not give them a chance too?~ [QUAYL22]
@108  = ~Forget all that other rubbish, any peon can see those things at any flea-ridden circus in the boondocks.~

@110  = ~Picky, picky.. beggars cannot be choosers, old 'PAL'.~
@111  = ~Tickets for the flying elephants are very expensive and they don't give the staff any freebies, but I might be able to get you a ticket for the dog show.~ [QUAYL24]

@116  = ~Suffice to say, not the likely outcome.~ [QUAYL09]
@117  = ~Will you shut up! I can't take it any more.~
@118  = ~If you keep up with this inane babble I might just cut my own head off!!~ [KORGAN23]
@119  = ~My great intellect leads me to believe that the chances of that happening are very slim..~
@120  = ~By the way, did I tell you I found a store in the city that will sell us healing potions for ten percent less then what we were being charged elsewhere?~
@121  = ~Just think of all the gold we will be able to save and put into a joint venture! I can just see it now.. We would be the first owners of a chain of stores across all of Faerûn that has designer clothing for us little people.~
@122  = ~Of course since it was my idea, I'll be president and chairman of the board.. but as a full investor and trusted colleague, I could see fit to making you my vice president.~ [QUAYL30]

@124  = ~Say Queasy, do you remember the time that old rascal, Dwobbert, cast that illusion that had all those villagers believing that the trees were growing precious emeralds and sapphires?~
@125  = ~HA! How could anyone forget that? All those excited people..~
@126  = ~And then the collective look of disappointment when they realized that they were holding nothing but worthless fruit.. simply brilliant!~
@127  = ~Hahahahahaha, the best thing was that they started pelting each other with it when the frustration grew.. Oh, it was a joy!~
@128  = ~Good old Dwobbert, he was the best spell weaver of us all back then.~
@129  = ~Yeah.. what ever happened to him anyways?~
@130  = ~Well.. he toured in the circus for a short time before he was picked up by an exclusive adventuring guild.~
@131  = ~He had many adventures and made a fortune, but with Dwobbert, it was never enough.~
@132  = ~One day while on an adventure, he decided to pick a fight with a hill giant that was taking a shower in a waterfall and got crushed by a boulder.~
@133  = ~Never did know when to keep his mouth shut, that one.~
@134  = ~Ouch! Poor guy.. he was always was spreading himself too thin. What a tragic ending!~
@135  = ~Tragic yes, but not really and ending for you see, the adventuring guild he was working for was very wealthy.~
@136  = ~And as a reward for all his dedicated service to the guild, they had him resurrected despite the severe damage that was done.~
@137  = ~But because the cost of the ritual was so high and there was no way he could ever afford to pay them back, Dwobbert had to retire and become a servant to the church.~
@138  = ~Eventually he married a servant girl also working there, they settled down and had kids.~
@139  = ~Well.. whatever ends well. I say he would have been better off if he had just become a turnip farmer.~
@140  = ~Mmm.. or stayed at the circus.~ [QUAYL35]
@141  = ~So Tiax, when you rule all *cough* *cough* Toril, how will things be organized?~ [QUAYL41]
@142  = ~According to the whims and desires of Tiax the Wise.~ [tiaxk]
@143  = ~Yes, yes, but have you thought about the complexities of ruling over several kingdoms, some with over a hundred individual fiefdoms within them?~
@144  = ~That level of micro-management is both time consuming and stressful. How are you going to control such vast empires in your absence, for even all-powerful Tiax cannot be at all places at once?~
@145  = ~Cyric will reveal the path when the time is ready.~ [TIAXA]
@146  = ~Rigggghhht.. the evil god Cyric, also known as the Dark Sun, the Mad God and Prince of Lies.. sounds like a good source for guidance.~
@147  = ~You know, you really should start looking into other religions.~
@148  = ~BAH! With Cyric's Dark Sun illuminating the night sky, Tiax the Gnomequeror will bring order to the chaos of the world and all things will be brought into order!~ [TIAXD]
@149  = ~Yeah whatever.. anyone want some popcorn?~
@150  = ~So tell me Jan, do any of your wacky gadgets ever pan out into something profitable?~
@151  = ~Not everyone thinks the way you do, Queasy.~
@152  = ~Yes.. only the smart ones.~
@153  = ~I do what I do, to make life easier for other gnomes.~
@154  = ~That is good and well, but where is the sense in doing something for others without getting some gold in return?~
@155  = ~If your brain was as big as mine, you would understand that.~
@156  = ~Queasy.. I just a simple turnip farmer that tinkers with gadgets on the side. Those dreams of grandeur are as foreign to me as a dwarf from Kara-Tura. It is life's simple pleasures that I enjoy most.~
@157  = ~You need to smarten up, friend!~
@158  = ~So Tiax, will be preaching any more proverbs from Cyric today?~
@159  = ~Yes, the kind that ends with Tiax the Great, ruling all the world!!~ [TIAXA]
@160  = ~Oh.. so just the normal idiocy. I was hoping for something more creative.~
@161  = ~If you want creativity, go to an art museum..~
@162  = ~I prefer the iron-fisted approach to getting your goals accomplished.~ [TIAXS]
@163  = ~Ahh Tiax. Had you asked I would have said you were too dumb to live..~ [QUAYL41]
@164  = ~Shut up.. FOOL!! When Tiax rules, I shall see to it that you are cast into a pit of dung!~ [TIAX#]
@165  = ~Well.. it couldn't stink worse than your banter. UGH! I am getting stupid just being near you!~ [QUAYL07]
@166  = ~You know, Tiax, as stupid as you are, its almost a mathematical miracle that you have survived this long.~
@167  = ~Tell us, what are you going to do when your luck runs out?~
@168  = ~Tiax the Grand does not need luck! Tiax has the destiny that Cyric has set forth for him to follow.~
@169  = ~Of course, how could I forget, you only mention it ten thousand times a day?~
@170  = ~Tiax must be certain that his subjects are well versed in his laws, for it won't be long now until he rules!~
@171  = ~You really ought to pick to crust from your beard. It is beginning to look very unsightly.~
@172  = ~Bah! Tiax will rule all.. Crust, or no crust!~
@173  = ~She looks familiar. I think I may have traveled with her for a short time last winter, near Baldur's Gate.~
@174  = ~Violence is a trademark of low intelligence! ~ [QUAYL30]
@175  = ~The stupid will fall while the smart survive.~ [QUAYL40]
@176  = ~If I'm so smart, what am I doing down here?~ [QUAYL14]
@177  = ~I am getting stupid just being near you! You are unteachable! Goodbye!~ [QUAYL07]
@178  = ~Am I to understand that he wants us to agree to a quest, without even knowing what it is? How stupid do the rest of you look for him to assume that?~ [QUAYL20]
@179  = ~He obviously has no idea of my superior intellect. Feel my amazing brain! Go on, touch it!~ [QUAYL25]
@180  = ~Only the truly inept would resort to such evil as this!  I'll not stand much more!~ [QUAYL06]
@181  = ~Be silent!~
@182  = ~The mind atrophies with disuse! Let's do something!~ [QUAYL10]

@188  = ~Are we really working for these knuckle dragging baboons? *sigh* I'm too smart for this!~ [QUAYL20]
@189  = ~Good show, Edwin. You almost smart enough to rival my superior intellect.~ [QUAYL23]
@190  = ~With my mega-mind helping you run the place, we could raise the efficiency and profits of the guildhouse by a thousand percent before the next season.~ [QUAYL23]

@197  = ~Only a small-minded fool would derive pleasure from torturing helpless victims!~
@198  = ~Is your brain damaged, boy, because only an idiot would stay around here?~
@199  = ~Why should we care what happens to these miserable, simple-minded fools?~
@200  = ~We should be at the library inside the Goldspires, researching ancient arcane knowledge, but NO! You have to get us involved in every quest in the land. I find this approach, unwise!~
@201  = ~I suppose it falls upon us to find a solution for these cabbage-headed ogres!~
@202  = ~It is not very intelligent to believe what a vampire is telling you.~
@203  = ~Yes and it probably never would have happened if you were not so STUPID!~

@206  = ~It would be easy to figure out if you were not a simple-minded ogre!~
@207  = ~You are an idiot for giving gold to this beggar. If you gave a gold coin to every beggar in the city you would have used up all your wealth and not changed a thing as they would all still be begging the next day!~
@208  = ~Worse still, you would find yourself, begging with them!~
@209  = ~What you are doing is severely lacking in intelligence.~
@210  = ~I must tell you. I will no longer suffer this charity!~
@211  = ~My brilliant mind tells me that we are dealing with more than just monsters.~

@219 = ~<CHARNAME>, it would be very foolish to have travelled this far with you and then quit at the last minute! If I left you now, I would not have been able to look at myself in the mirror for the rest of my life. So stop talking and let's go fight this unintelligent sorcerer.~
