@5    = ~Suffice it to say that the dark forces gave me another chance.~
@6    = ~However, I am not here to resume our quarrel, Coran, or the Bhaalspawn. There are much more important things at hand.~
@7    = ~So speaks a women with experience! As if it is not bad enough that you have stolen me love from me...~

@38   = ~I know she has not earned our respect or trust, perhaps we should help her.~
@39   = ~Afterall, you can't live life without a little adventure.~ [coran26]
