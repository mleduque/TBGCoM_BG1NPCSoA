@275 = ~Tiax must rule the world, this is his destiny! I will fulfill your will, mighty Cyric! <CHARNAME>, you will pay for this embarrassment and finally suffer the rightly-swift judgement of the mighty Tiax!~ [PPTIAX03]
@276 = ~Right! <CHARNAME> lives and dies at the behest of Cyric! ~
@277 = ~<CHARNAME> is but a pathetic pebble underneath the mighty foot of Tiax. <CHARNAME> is a mere blunt needle compared to the massive jaws of destruction that Tiax wields. <CHARNAME> lives only at the regard of Tiax. How is that Tiax is asked to do such effortless tasks?~
@278 = ~No!  This Cyric is but a feeble shadow of the real Cyric!  The real Cyric does not make demands! Demands themselves beg Cyric to exist! Cyric does what he alone wishes!~ [PPTIAX08]
@279 = ~In the name of Tiax we must slaughter this impostor and all who align themselves with him!~
@280 = ~Who is this impostor that dares mock Cyric!? A mere imp unworthy to taste Tiax's discarded scraps!~
@281 = ~You shall quickly fall to Tiax's might!  Cyric aid me!~ [TIAX8]
@282 = ~Ahahahahaha!!! I haven't laughed like that for a long time! Bravo, <CHARNAME>! ~
@283 = ~<CHARNAME>, you helped Tiax defeat the minions of this scoundrel who pretends to be Cyric. For this, you will be honored to continue serving Tiax.~ [TIAX3]
@284 = ~Now about you, gnome... ~

// NEW (v.13.3)
@285 = ~My wonderful brain tells me that this Melissan is keeping quiet about a scheme she is concocting, since she hasn't said anything about her role in the rise of Balthazar. No need to thank me. I know you would never have guessed yourself!~
@286 = ~Bah! Tiax will have a thousand times more children than this pathetic Bhaal! And those who are not children of Tiax will be forced to pay a heavy tax!~ [TIAXA]
@287 = ~Of course <PRO_HESHE> was not ready for the power, you unknown angel! Because it will not be <PRO_HESHE> that will rule, but Tiax! So Cyric decided!~ [PPTIAX09]
@288 = ~I know who you are, Tiax the gnome. I know who you were before and how you became who you are. However, I am not talking to you now.~
@289 = ~No matter what place it is, Tiax will still rule it!~ [PPTIAX02]
@290 = ~Who would have thought that this idiotic gnome would live and that *I* would die and become a shadow of my former self? In such moments, you begin to ponder that fate is laughing at us and punishing us for our pride.~
@291 = ~Why didn't you prepare properly for the arrival of Tiax the Great, foolish old man?~ [PPTIAX15]
@292 = ~Tiax the who...? I don't believe I have ever heard of someone with such a title before.~
@293 = ~Such insolence! All know who Tiax is! Tiax's greatness flows through the lands... even the planes themselves! Tiax is destined to rule all!~ [PPTIAX14]
@294 = ~Oh... a... sorry your "lordship", I had no idea... (Seriously, who is this nut case?)~
@295 = ~Very well then book keeper, you are pardoned for now and Tiax will accept your apology, but make that mistake again and you will face the consequences of Tiax the great!~ [TIAX2]
@296 = ~Very well my lord... I, uh, thank you for your generosity...?~
